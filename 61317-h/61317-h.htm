<h2><span class="smaller">ON THE</span><br />
IMITATION<br />
<span class="smaller">OF THE<br />
<span class="smcap">Painting</span> and <span class="smcap">Sculpture</span> of the GREEKS.</span></h2>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">Nature.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">To the Greek climate we owe the
production of <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Taste</em></span>, and from
thence it spread at length over all the politer
world. Every invention, communicated by
foreigners to that nation, was but the feed
of what it became afterwards, changing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
both its nature and size in a country, chosen,
as <i>Plato</i><a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> says, by Minerva, to be inhabited
by the Greeks, as productive of every kind
of genius.</p>

<p>But this <span class="smcap"><em class="gesperrt">Taste</em></span> was not only original
among the Greeks, but seemed also quite
peculiar to their country: it seldom went
abroad without loss; and was long ere it
imparted its kind influences to more distant
climes. It was, doubtless, a stranger to the
northern zones, when Painting and Sculpture,
those offsprings of Greece, were despised
there to such a degree, that the most
valuable pieces of <i>Corregio</i> served only for
blinds to the windows of the royal stables
at Stockholm.</p>

<p>There is but one way for the moderns to
become great, and perhaps unequalled; I
mean, by imitating the antients. And what
we are told of <i>Homer</i>, that whoever understands
him well, admires him, we find no
less true in matters concerning the antient,
especially the Greek arts. But then we must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
be as familiar with them as with a friend,
to find Laocoon as inimitable as <i>Homer</i>. By
such intimacy our judgment will be that of
<i>Nicomachus</i>: <i>Take these eyes</i>, replied he to
some paltry critick, censuring the Helen of
Zeuxis, <i>Take my eyes, and she will appear a
goddess</i>.</p>

<p>With such eyes <i>Michael Angelo</i>, <i>Raphael</i>,
and <i>Poussin</i>, considered the performances of
the antients. They imbibed taste at its
source; and Raphael particularly in its native
country. We know, that he sent
young artists to Greece, to copy there, for
his use, the remains of antiquity.</p>

<p>An antient Roman statue, compared to
a Greek one, will generally appear like
<i>Virgil</i>’s Diana amidst her Oreads, in comparison
of the Nausicaa of <i>Homer</i>, whom
he imitated.</p>

<p>Laocoon was the standard of the Roman
artists, as well as ours; and the rules of
<i>Polycletus</i> became the rules of art.</p>

<p>I need not put the reader in mind of the
negligences to be met with in the most celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
antient performances: the Dolphin
at the feet of the Medicean Venus, with the
children, and the Parerga of the Diomedes
by <i>Dioscorides</i>, being commonly known.
The reverse of the best Egyptian and Syrian
coins seldom equals the head, in point of
workmanship. Great artists are wisely negligent,
and even their errors instruct. Behold
their works as <i>Lucian</i> bids you behold
the Zeus of <i>Phidias</i>; <i>Zeus himself, not his
footstool</i>.</p>

<p>It is not only <i>Nature</i> which the votaries
of the Greeks find in their works, but still
more, something superior to nature; ideal
beauties, brain-born images, as <i>Proclus</i> says<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>The most beautiful body of ours would
perhaps be as much inferior to the most
beautiful Greek one, as Iphicles was to his
brother Hercules. The forms of the Greeks,
prepared to beauty, by the influence of the
mildest and purest sky, became perfectly
elegant by their early exercises. Take a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Spartan youth, sprung from heroes, undistorted
by swaddling-cloths; whose bed,
from his seventh year, was the earth, familiar
with wrestling and swimming from his
infancy; and compare him with one of our
young Sybarits, and then decide which of
the two would be deemed worthy, by an
artist, to serve for the model of a Theseus,
an Achilles, or even a Bacchus. The latter
would produce a Theseus fed on roses,
the former a Theseus fed on flesh, to borrow
the expression of <i>Euphranor</i>.</p>

<p>The grand games were always a very
strong incentive for every Greek youth to
exercise himself. Whoever aspired to the
honours of these was obliged, by the laws, to
submit to a trial of ten months at Elis, the
general rendezvous; and there the first rewards
were commonly won by youths, as
<i>Pindar</i> tells us.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><i>To be like the God-like Diagoras</i>,
was the fondest wish of every youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Behold the swift Indian outstripping in
pursuit the hart: how briskly his juices circulate!
how flexible, how elastic his nerves
and muscles! how easy his whole frame!
Thus <i>Homer</i> draws his heroes, and his
Achilles he eminently marks for “being
swift of foot.”</p>

<p>By these exercises the bodies of the Greeks
got the great and manly Contour observed
in their statues, without any bloated corpulency.
The young Spartans were bound
to appear every tenth day naked before the
Ephori, who, when they perceived any inclinable
to fatness, ordered them a scantier
diet; nay, it was one of <i>Pythagoras</i>’s precepts,
to beware of growing too corpulent;
and, perhaps for the same reason, youths
aspiring to wrestling-games were, in the remoter
ages of Greece, during their trial, confined
to a milk diet.</p>

<p>They were particularly cautious in avoiding
every deforming custom; and <i>Alcibiades</i>,
when a boy, refusing to learn to play on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the flute, for fear of its discomposing his
features, was followed by all the youth of
Athens.</p>

<p>In their dress they were professed followers
of nature. No modern stiffening habit, no
squeezing stays hindered Nature from forming
easy beauty; the fair knew no anxiety
about their attire, and from their loose and
short habits the Spartan girls got the epithet
of Phænomirides.</p>

<p>We know what pains they took to have
handsome children, but want to be acquainted
with their methods: for certainly <i>Quillet</i>, in
his Callipædy, falls short of their numerous
expedients. They even attempted changing
blue eyes to black ones, and games of
beauty were exhibited at Elis, the rewards
consisting of arms consecrated to the temple
of Minerva. How could they miss of competent
and learned judges, when, as <i>Aristotle</i>
tells us, the Grecian youths were taught
drawing expressly for that purpose? From
their fine complexion, which, though mingled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
with a vast deal of foreign blood, is still
preserved in most of the Greek islands, and
from the still enticing beauty of the fair sex,
especially at Chios; we may easily form an
idea of the beauty of the former inhabitants,
who boasted of being Aborigines, nay,
more antient than the moon.</p>

<p>And are not there several modern nations,
among whom beauty is too common to give
any title to pre-eminence? Such are unanimously
accounted the Georgians and the Kabardinski
in the Crim.</p>

<p>Those diseases which are destructive of
beauty, were moreover unknown to the
Greeks. There is not the least hint of the
small-pox, in the writings of their physicians;
and <i>Homer</i>, whose portraits are always
so truly drawn, mentions not one pitted
face. Venereal plagues, and their daughter
the English malady, had not yet names.</p>

<p>And must we not then, considering every
advantage which nature bestows, or art
teaches, for forming, preserving, and improving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
beauty, enjoyed and applied by
the Grecians; must we not then confess,
there is the strongest probability that the
beauty of their persons excelled all we can
have an idea of?</p>

<p>Art claims liberty: in vain would nature
produce her noblest offsprings, in a country
where rigid laws would choak her progressive
growth, as in Egypt, that pretended
parent of sciences and arts: but in Greece,
where, from their earliest youth, the happy
inhabitants were devoted to mirth and pleasure,
where narrow-spirited formality never
restrained the liberty of manners, the artist
enjoyed nature without a veil.</p>

<p>The Gymnasies, where, sheltered by public
modesty, the youths exercised themselves
naked, were the schools of art. These the
philosopher frequented, as well as the artist.
<i>Socrates</i> for the instruction of a Charmides,
Autolycus, Lysis; <i>Phidias</i> for the improvement
of his art by their beauty. Here he
studied the elasticity of the muscles, the ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
varying motions of the frame, the outlines
of fair forms, or the Contour left by the
young wrestler on the sand. Here beautiful
nakedness appeared with such a liveliness of
expression, such truth and variety of situations,
such a noble air of the body, as it
would be ridiculous to look for in any hired
model of our academies.</p>

<p>Truth springs from the feelings of the
heart. What shadow of it therefore can
the modern artist hope for, by relying upon
a vile model, whose soul is either too base
to feel, or too stupid to express the passions,
the sentiment his object claims? unhappy
he! if experience and fancy fail him.</p>

<p>The beginning of many of <i>Plato</i>’s dialogues,
supposed to have been held in the
Gymnasies, cannot raise our admiration of
the generous souls of the Athenian youth,
without giving us, at the same time, a strong
presumption of a suitable nobleness in their
outward carriage and bodily exercises.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>The fairest youths danced undressed on the
theatre; and <i>Sophocles</i>, the great <i>Sophocles</i>,
when young, was the first who dared to entertain
his fellow-citizens in this manner.
<i>Phryne</i> went to bathe at the Eleusinian
games, exposed to the eyes of all Greece,
and rising from the water became the model
of Venus Anadyomene. During certain solemnities
the young Spartan maidens danced
naked before the young men: strange this
may seem, but will appear more probable,
when we consider that the christians of the
primitive church, both men and women,
were dipped together in the same font.</p>

<p>Then every solemnity, every festival, afforded
the artist opportunity to familiarize
himself with all the beauties of Nature.</p>

<p>In the most happy times of their freedom,
the humanity of the Greeks abhorred
bloody games, which even in the Ionick
Asia had ceased long before, if, as some
guess, they had once been usual there. <i>Antiochus
Epiphanes</i>, by ordering shews of Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
gladiators, first presented them with
such unhappy victims; and custom and
time, weakening the pangs of sympathizing
humanity, changed even these games into
schools of art. There <i>Ctesias</i> studied his
dying gladiator, in whom you might descry
“how much life was still left in him<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.”</p>

<p>These frequent occasions of observing Nature,
taught the Greeks to go on still farther.
They began to form certain general ideas of
beauty, with regard to the proportions of
the inferiour parts, as well as of the whole
frame: these they raised above the reach of
mortality, according to the superiour model
of some ideal nature.</p>

<p>Thus <i>Raphael</i> formed his Galatea, as we
learn by his letter to Count Baltazar Castiglione<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>,
where he says, “Beauty being so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
seldom found among the fair, I avail myself
of a certain ideal image.”</p>

<p>According to those ideas, exalted above
the pitch of material models, the Greeks
formed their gods and heroes: the profile of
the brow and nose of gods and goddesses is
almost a streight line. The same they gave
on their coins to queens, &amp;c. but without
indulging their fancy too much. Perhaps
this profile was as peculiar to the antient
Greeks, as flat noses and little eyes to the
Calmucks and Chinese; a supposition which
receives some strength from the large eyes
of all the heads on Greek coins and gems.</p>

<p>From the same ideas the Romans formed
their Empresses on their coins. Livia
and Agrippina have the profile of Artemisia
and Cleopatra.</p>

<p>We observe, nevertheless, that the Greek
artists in general, submitted to the law prescribed
by the Thebans: “To do, under
a penalty, their best in imitating Nature.”
For, where they could not possibly apply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
their easy profile, without endangering the
resemblance, they followed Nature, as we
see instanced in the beauteous head of Julia,
the daughter of Titus, done by <i>Euodus</i><a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.</p>

<p>But to form a “just resemblance, and,
at the same time, a handsomer one,” being
always the chief rule they observed, and
which <i>Polygnotus</i> constantly went by; they
must, of necessity, be supposed to have had
in view a more beauteous and more perfect
Nature. And when we are told, that some
artists imitated <i>Praxiteles</i>, who took his concubine
<i>Cratina</i> for the model of his Cnidian
Venus; or that others formed the graces
from <i>Lais</i>; it is to be understood that they
did so, without neglecting these great laws
of the art. Sensual beauty furnished the
painter with all that nature could give; ideal
beauty with the awful and sublime; from
that he took the <i>Humane</i>, from this the
<i>Divine</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Let any one, sagacious enough to pierce
into the depths of art, compare the whole
system of the Greek figures with that of the
moderns, by which, as they say, nature alone
is imitated; good heaven! what a number
of neglected beauties will he not discover!</p>

<p>For instance, in most of the modern
figures, if the skin happens to be any where
pressed, you see there several little smart
wrinkles: when, on the contrary, the same
parts, pressed in the same manner on Greek
statues, by their soft undulations, form at
last but one noble pressure. These master-pieces
never shew us the skin forcibly stretched,
but softly embracing the firm flesh, which
fills it up without any tumid expansion, and
harmoniously follows its direction. There
the skin never, as on modern bodies, appears
in plaits distinct from the flesh.</p>

<p>Modern works are likewise distinguished
from the antient by parts; a crowd of small
touches and dimples too sensibly drawn. In
antient works you find these distributed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
sparing sagacity, and, as relative to a completer
and more perfect Nature, offered
but as hints, nay, often perceived only by
the learned.</p>

<p>The probability still increases, that the
bodies of the Greeks, as well as the works
of their artists, were framed with more unity
of system, a nobler harmony of parts, and
a completeness of the whole, above our
lean tensions and hollow wrinkles.</p>

<p>Probability, ’tis true, is all we can pretend
to: but it deserves the attention of our
artists and connoisseurs the rather, as the veneration
professed for the antient monuments
is commonly imputed to prejudice, and not
to their excellence; as if the numerous
ages, during which they have mouldered,
were the only motive for bestowing on them
exalted praises, and setting them up for the
standards of imitation.</p>

<p>Such as would fain deny to the Greeks
the advantages both of a more perfect Nature
and of ideal Beauties, boast of the famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
<i>Bernini</i>, as their great champion. He
was of opinion, besides, that Nature was
possessed of every requisite beauty: the only
skill being to discover that. He boasted
of having got rid of a prejudice concerning
the Medicean Venus, whose charms he at
first thought peculiar ones; but, after many
careful researches, discovered them now and
then in Nature<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.</p>

<p>He was taught then, by the Venus, to
discover beauties in common Nature, which
he had formerly thought peculiar to that
statue, and but for it, never would have searched
for them. Follows it not from thence, that
the beauties of the Greek statues being discovered
with less difficulty than those of Nature,
are of course more affecting; not so
diffused, but more harmoniously united?
and if this be true, the pointing out of Nature
as chiefly imitable, is leading us into
a more tedious and bewildered road to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
knowledge of perfect beauty, than setting up
the ancients for that purpose: consequently
<i>Bernini</i>, by adhering too strictly to Nature,
acted against his own principles, as well as
obstructed the progress of his disciples.</p>

<p>The imitation of beauty is either reduced
to a single object, and is <i>individual</i>, or, gathering
observations from single ones, <i>composes
of these one whole</i>. The former we call
copying, drawing a portrait; ’tis the straight
way to Dutch forms and figures; whereas
the other leads to general beauty, and its
ideal images, and is the way the Greeks took.
But there is still this difference between them
and us: they enjoying daily occasions of
seeing beauty, (suppose even not superior
to ours,) acquired those ideal riches with
less toil than we, confined as we are to a
few and often fruitless opportunities, ever
can hope for. It would be no easy matter,
I fancy, for our nature, to produce a frame
equal in beauty to that of Antinous; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
surely no idea can soar above the more than
human proportions of a deity, in the Apollo
of the Vatican, which is a compound of the
united force of Nature, Genius, and Art.</p>

<p>Their imitation discovering in the one
every beauty diffused through Nature, shewing
in the other the pitch to which the
most perfect Nature can elevate herself,
when soaring above the senses, will quicken
the genius of the artist, and shorten his
discipleship: he will learn to think and
draw with confidence, seeing here the fixed
limits of human and divine beauty.</p>

<p>Building on this ground, his hand and
senses directed by the Greek rule of beauty,
the modern artist goes on the surest way to
the imitation of Nature. The ideas of
unity and perfection, which he acquired in
meditating on antiquity, will help him to
combine, and to ennoble the more scattered
and weaker beauties of our Nature. Thus
he will improve every beauty he discovers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
it, and by comparing the beauties of nature
with the ideal, form rules for himself.</p>

<p>Then, and not sooner, he, particularly
the painter, may be allowed to commit himself
to Nature, especially in cases where his
art is beyond the instruction of the old marbles,
to wit, in drapery; then, like <i>Poussin</i>,
he may proceed with more liberty; for “a
timid follower will never get the start of
his leaders, and he who is at a loss to
produce something of his own, will be
a bad manager of the productions of another,”
as <i>Michael Angelo</i> says; Minds
favoured by Nature,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent5"><i>Quibus Arte benigna,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Et meliore luto, finxit præcordia Titan,</i></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">have here a plain way to become originals.</p>

<p>Thus the account <i>de Piles</i> gives, ought
to be understood, that <i>Raphael</i>, a short time
before he was carried off by death, intended
to forsake the marbles, in order to addict
himself wholly to Nature. True antient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
taste would most certainly have guided him
through every maze of common Nature;
and whatever observations, whatever new
ideas he might have reaped from that, they
would all, by a kind of chymical transmutation,
have been changed to his own essence
and soul.</p>

<p>He, perhaps, might have indulged more
variety; enlarged his draperies; improved
his colours, his light and shadow: but none
of these improvements would have raised
his pictures to that high esteem they deserve,
for that noble Contour, and that sublimity
of thoughts, which he acquired from the
ancients.</p>

<p>Nothing would more decisively prove the
advantages to be got by imitating the ancients,
preferably to Nature, than an essay
made with two youths of equal talents, by
devoting the one to antiquity, the other to
Nature: this would draw Nature as he
finds her; if Italian, perhaps he might paint
like <i>Caravaggio</i>; if Flemish, and lucky,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
like <i>Jac. Jordans</i>; if French, like <i>Stella</i>:
the other would draw her as she directs,
and paint like <i>Raphael</i>.</p>

<h3>II. <span class="smcap">Contour.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">But even supposing that the imitation
of Nature could supply all the artist
wants, she never could bestow the precision
of Contour, that characteristic distinction of
the ancients.</p>

<p>The noblest Contour unites or circumscribes
every part of the most perfect Nature,
and the ideal beauties in the figures of the
Greeks; or rather, contains them both.
<i>Euphranor</i>, famous after the epoch of <i>Zeuxis</i>,
is said to have first ennobled it.</p>

<p>Many of the moderns have attempted to
imitate this Contour, but very few with success.
The great <i>Rubens</i> is far from having
attained either its precision or elegance, especially
in the performances which he finished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
before he went to Italy, and studied the antiques.</p>

<p>The line by which Nature divides completeness
from superfluity is but a small one,
and, insensible as it often is, has been crossed
even by the best moderns; while these, in
shunning a meagre Contour, became corpulent,
those, in shunning that, grew lean.</p>

<p>Among them all, only <i>Michael Angelo</i>,
perhaps, may be said to have attained the
antique; but only in strong muscular figures,
heroic frames; not in those of tender youth;
nor in female bodies, which, under his bold
hand, grew Amazons.</p>

<p>The Greek artist, on the contrary, adjusted
his Contour, in every figure, to the
breadth of a single hair, even in the nicest
and most tiresome performances, as gems.
Consider the Diomedes and Perseus of <i>Dioscorides</i><a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>,
Hercules and Iole by <i>Teucer</i><a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>, and
admire the inimitable Greeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Parrhasius</i>, they say, was master of the
correctest Contour.</p>

<p>This Contour reigns in Greek figures,
even when covered with drapery, as the
chief aim of the artist; the beautiful frame
pierces the marble like a transparent <i>Coan</i>
cloth.</p>

<p>The high-stiled Agrippina, and the three
vestals in the royal cabinet at Dresden, deserve
to be mentioned as eminent proofs of
this. This Agrippina seems not the mother
of Nero, but an elder one, the spouse of
Germanicus. She much resembles another
pretended Agrippina, in the parlour of the
library of St. Marc, at Venice<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. Ours is a
sitting figure, above the size of Nature, her
head inclined on her right hand; her fine
face speaks a soul “pining in thought,” absorbed
in pensive sorrow, and senseless to
every outward impression. The artist, I
suppose, intended to draw his heroine in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
mournful moment she received the news of
her banishment to Pandataria.</p>

<p>The three vestals deserve our esteem from
a double title: as being the first important
discoveries of Herculaneum, and models of
the sublimest drapery. All three, but particularly
one above the natural size, would,
with regard to that, be worthy companions
of the Farnesian <i>Flora</i>, and all the other
boasts of antiquity. The two others seem,
by their resemblance to each other, productions
of the same hand, only distinguished
by their heads, which are not of equal goodness.
On the best the curled hairs, running
in furrows from the forehead, are tied on
the neck: on the other the hair being smooth
on the scalp, and curled on the front, is
gathered behind, and tied with a ribband:
this head seems of a modern hand, but a
good one.</p>

<p>There is no veil on these heads; but that
makes not against their being vestals: for
the priestesses of Vesta (I speak on proof)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
were not always veiled; or rather, as the
drapery seems to betray, the veil, which
was of one piece with the garments, being
thrown backwards, mingles with the cloaths
on the neck.</p>

<p>’Tis to these three inimitable pieces that
the world owes the first hints of the ensuing
discovery of the subterranean treasures of
Herculaneum.</p>

<p>Their discovery happened when the
same ruins that overwhelmed the town had
nearly extinguished the unhappy remembrance
of it: when the tremendous fate that
spoke its doom was only known by the account
which Pliny gives of his uncle’s
death.</p>

<p>These great master-pieces of the Greek
art were transplanted, and worshipped in Germany,
long before Naples could boast of one
single Herculanean monument.</p>

<p>They were discovered in the year 1706 at
Portici near Naples, in a ruinous vault, on
occasion of digging the foundations of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
villa, for the Prince d’Elbeuf, and immediately,
with other new discovered marble
and metal statues, came into the possession
of Prince Eugene, and were transported to
Vienna.</p>

<p>Eugene, who well knew their value, provided
a Sala Terrena to be built expressly for
them, and a few others: and so highly were
they esteemed, that even on the first rumour
of their sale, the academy and the artists
were in an uproar, and every body, when
they were transported to Dresden, followed
them with heavy eyes.</p>

<p>The famous <i>Matielli</i>, to whom</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>His rule Polyclet, his chissel Phidias gave,</i></div>
<div class="attr">Algarotti.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">copied them in clay before their removal,
and following them some years after, filled
Dresden with everlasting monuments of his
art: but even there he studied the drapery
of his priestesses, (drapery his chief skill!)
till he laid down his chissel, and thus gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the most striking proof of their excellence.</p>

<h3>III. <span class="smcap">Drapery.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">By Drapery is to be understood all that the
art teaches of covering the nudities, and
folding the garments; and this is the third
prerogative of the ancients.</p>

<p>The Drapery of the vestals above, is grand
and elegant. The smaller foldings spring gradually
from the larger ones, and in them are
lost again, with a noble freedom, and gentle
harmony of the whole, without hiding
the correct Contour. How few of the moderns
would stand the test here!</p>

<p>Justice, however, shall not be refused to
some great modern artists, who, without impairing
nature or truth, have left, in certain
cases, the road which the ancients generally
pursued. The Greek Drapery, in order
to help the Contour, was, for the most part,
taken from thin and wet garments, which of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
course clasped the body, and discovered the
shape. The robe of the Greek ladies was extremely
thin; thence its epithet of Peplon.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the reliefs, the pictures, and
particularly the busts of the ancients, are instances
that they did not always keep to this
undulating Drapery<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.</p>

<p>In modern times the artists were forced
to heap garments, and sometimes heavy
ones, on each other, which of course could
not fall into the flowing folds of the ancients.
Hence the large-folded Drapery, by
which the painter and sculptor may display
as much skill as by the ancient manner.
<i>Carlo Marat</i> and <i>Francis Solimena</i> may
be called the chief masters of it: but the
garments of the new Venetian school, by
passing the bounds of nature and propriety,
became stiff as brass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<h3>IV. <span class="smcap">Expression.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">The last and most eminent characteristic
of the Greek works is a noble simplicity
and sedate grandeur in Gesture and Expression.
As the bottom of the sea lies
peaceful beneath a foaming surface, a great
soul lies sedate beneath the strife of passions
in Greek figures.</p>

<p>’Tis in the face of Laocoon this soul
shines with full lustre, not confined however
to the face, amidst the most violent
sufferings. Pangs piercing every muscle,
every labouring nerve; pangs which we almost
feel ourselves, while we consider—not
the face, nor the most expressive parts—only
the belly contracted by excruciating
pains: these however, I say, exert not themselves
with violence, either in the face or
gesture. He pierces not heaven, like the
Laocoon of <i>Virgil</i>; his mouth is rather
opened to discharge an anxious overloaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
groan, as <i>Sadolet</i> says; the struggling body
and the supporting mind exert themselves
with equal strength, nay balance all the
frame.</p>

<p>Laocoon suffers, but suffers like the Philoctetes
of <i>Sophocles</i>: we weeping feel his
pains, but wish for the hero’s strength to
support his misery.</p>

<p>The Expression of so great a soul is beyond
the force of mere nature. It was in
his own mind the artist was to search for
the strength of spirit with which he marked
his marble. Greece enjoyed artists and philosophers
in the same persons; and the
wisdom of more than one Metrodorus directed
art, and inspired its figures with more
than common souls.</p>

<p>Had Laocoon been covered with a garb
becoming an antient sacrificer, his sufferings
would have lost one half of their Expression.
<i>Bernini</i> pretended to perceive the first
effects of the operating venom in the numbness
of one of the thighs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Every action or gesture in Greek figures,
not stamped with this character of sage dignity,
but too violent, too passioniate, was
called “Parenthyrsos.”</p>

<p>For, the more tranquillity reigns in a body,
the fitter it is to draw the true character of
the soul; which, in every excessive gesture,
seems to rush from her proper centre, and
being hurried away by extremes becomes
unnatural. Wound up to the highest pitch
of passion, she may force herself upon the
duller eye; but the true sphere of her action
is simplicity and calmness. In Laocoon
sufferings alone had been Parenthyrsos; the
artist therefore, in order to reconcile the significative
and ennobling qualities of his soul,
put him into a posture, allowing for the sufferings
that were necessary, the next to a
state of tranquillity: a tranquillity however
that is characteristical: the soul will be herself—this
individual—not the soul of mankind;
sedate, but active; calm, but not indifferent
or drowsy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>What a contrast! how diametrically opposite
to this is the taste of our modern artists,
especially the young ones! on nothing
do they bestow their approbation, but contorsions
and strange postures, inspired with
boldness; this they pretend is done with spirit,
with <i>Franchezza</i>. Contrast is the darling of
their ideas; in it they fancy every perfection.
They fill their performances with comet-like
excentric souls, despising every thing
but an Ajax or a Capaneus.</p>

<p>Arts have their infancy as well as men;
they begin, as well as the artist, with froth
and bombast: in such buskins the muse of
Æschilus stalks, and part of the diction in
his Agamemnon is more loaded with hyperboles
than all Heraclitus’s nonsense. Perhaps
the primitive Greek painters drew in
the same manner that their first good tragedian
thought in.</p>

<p>In all human actions flutter and rashness
precede, sedateness and solidity follow:
but time only can discover, and the judicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
will admire these only: they are the
characteristics of great masters; violent passions
run away with their disciples.</p>

<p>The sages in the art know the difficulties
hid under that air of easiness:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent11"><i>ut sibi quivis</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Speret idem, sudet multum, frustraque laboret</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Ausus idem.</i></div>
<div class="attr">Hor.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><i>La Fage</i>, though an eminent designer, was
not able to attain the purity of ancient taste.
Every thing is animated in his works; they
demand, and at the same time dissipate, your
attention, like a company striving to talk
all at once.</p>

<p>This noble simplicity and sedate grandeur
is also the true characteristical mark of the
best and maturest Greek writings, of the
epoch and school of <i>Socrates</i>. Possessed of
these qualities <i>Raphael</i> became eminently
great, and he owed them to the ancients.</p>

<p>That great soul of his, lodged in a
beauteous body, was requisite for the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
discovery of the true character of the ancients:
he first felt all their beauties, and (what he
was peculiarly happy in!) at an age when
vulgar, unfeeling, and half-moulded souls
overlook every higher beauty.</p>

<p>Ye that approach his works, teach your
eyes to be sensible of those beauties, refine
your taste by the true antique, and then
that solemn tranquillity of the chief figures
in his <i>Attila</i>, deemed insipid by the vulgar,
will appear to you equally significant and
sublime. The Roman bishop, in order to
divert the Hun from his design of assailing
Rome, appears not with the air of a Rhetor,
but as a venerable man, whose very presence
softens uproar into peace; like him drawn
by Virgil:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Tum pietate gravem ac meritis, si forte virum quem</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Conspexere, silent, adrectisque auribus adstant:</i></div>
<div class="attr">Æn. I.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">full of confidence in God, he faces down the
barbarian: the two Apostles descend not
with the air of slaughtering angels, but (if
sacred may be compared with profane) like
Jove, whose very nod shakes Olympus.</p>

<p><i>Algardi</i>, in his celebrated representation
of the same story, done in bas-relief on an
altar in St. Peter’s church at Rome, was
either too negligent, or too weak, to give
this active tranquillity of his great predecessor
to the figures of his Apostles. There
they appear like messengers of the Lord of
Hosts: here like human warriors with mortal
arms.</p>

<p>How few of those we call connoisseurs
have ever been able to understand, and sincerely
to admire, the grandeur of expression
in the St. <i>Michael of Guido</i>, in the church
of the Capuchins at Rome! they prefer
commonly the Archangel of <i>Concha</i>, whose
face glows with indignation and revenge<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
whereas <i>Guido</i>’s Angel, after having overthrown
the fiend of God and man, hovers
over him unruffled and undismayed.</p>

<p>Thus, to heighten the hero of <i>The Campaign</i>,
victorious Marlborough, the British
poet paints the avenging Angel hovering
over Britannia with the like serenity and
awful calmness.</p>

<p>The royal gallery at Dresden contains
now, among its treasures, one of <i>Raphael</i>’s
best pictures, witness Vasari, &amp;c. a Madonna
with the Infant; St. Sixtus and St.
Barbara kneeling, one on each side, and two
Angels in the fore-part.</p>

<p>It was the chief altar-piece in the cloister
of St. Sixtus at Piacenza, which was crouded
by connoisseurs, who came to see this
Raphael, in the same manner as Thespis
was in the days of old, for the sake of the
beautiful Cupid of <i>Praxiteles</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Behold the Madonna! her face brightens
with innocence; a form above the female
size, and the calmness of her mien, make
her appear as already beatified: she has that
silent awfulness which the ancients spread
over their deities. How grand, how noble
is her Contour!</p>

<p>The child in her arms is elevated above
vulgar children, by a face darting the beams
of divinity through every smiling feature of
harmless childhood.</p>

<p>St. Barbara kneels, with adoring stillness,
at her side: but being far beneath the
majesty of the chief figure, the great artist
compensated her humbler graces with soft
enticing charms.</p>

<p>The Saint opposite to her is venerable
with age. His features seem to bear witness
of his sacred youth.</p>

<p>The veneration which St. Barbara declares
for the Madonna, expressed in the most
sensible and pathetic manner, by her fine
hands clasped on her breast, helps to support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the motion of one of St. Sixtus’s hands,
by which he utters his extasy, better becoming
(as the artist judiciously thought,
and chose for variety’s sake) manly strength,
than female modesty.</p>

<p>Time, ’tis true, has withered the primitive
splendour of this picture, and partly blown
off its lively colours; but still the soul, with
which the painter inspired his godlike work,
breathes life through all its parts.</p>

<p>Let those that approach this, and the rest
of <i>Raphael</i>’s works, in hopes of finding
there the trifling Dutch and Flemish beauties,
the laboured nicety of <i>Netscher</i>, or
<i>Douw</i>, flesh <i>ivorified</i> by <i>Van der Werf</i>, or
even the licked manner of some of <i>Raphael</i>’s
living countrymen; let those, I say,
be told, that <i>Raphael</i> was not a great master
for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<h3>V. <span class="smcap">Workmanship in Sculpture.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">After these remarks on the Nature,
the Contour, the Drapery, the simplicity
and grandeur of Expression in the performances
of the Greek artists, we shall
proceed to some inquiries into their method
of working.</p>

<p>Their models were generally made of
wax; instead of which the moderns used
clay, or such like unctuous stuff, as seeming
fitter for expressing flesh, than the more
gluey and tenacious wax.</p>

<p>A method however not new, though more
frequent in our times: for we know even
the name of that ancient who first attempted
modelling in wet clay; ’twas <i>Dibutades</i> of
Sicyon; and <i>Arcesilaus</i>, the friend of <i>Lucullus</i>,
grew more famous by his models of
clay than his other performances. He made
for <i>Lucullus</i> a figure of clay representing
<i>Happiness</i>, and received 60,000 sesterces:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and <i>Octavius</i>, a Roman Knight, paid him
a talent for the model only of a large dish,
in plaister, which he designed to have finished
in gold.</p>

<p>Of all materials, clay might be allowed
to be the fittest for shaping figures, could it
preserve its moistness; but losing that by
time or fire, its solider parts, contracting by degrees,
lessen the bulk of the mass; and that
which is formed, being of different diameters,
grows sooner dry in some parts than in others,
and the dry ones being shrunk to a smaller
size, there will be no proportion kept in the
whole.</p>

<p>From this inconvenience wax is always
free: it loses nothing of its bulk; and there
are also means to give it the smoothness
of flesh, which is refused to modelling;
viz. you make your model of clay, mould
it with plaister, and cast the wax over it.</p>

<p>But for transferring their models to the
marble, the Greeks seem to have possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
some peculiar advantages, which are now lost:
for you discover, every where in their works,
the traces of a confident hand; and even in
those of inferior rank, it would be no easy
matter to prove a wrong cut. Surely hands
so steady, so secure, must of necessity have
been guided by rules more determinate and
less arbitrary than we can boast of.</p>

<p>The usual method of our sculptors is, to
quarter the well-prepared model with horizontals
and perpendiculars, and, as is
common in copying a picture, to draw a relative
number of squares on the marble.</p>

<p>Thus, regular gradations of a scale being
supposed, every small square of the model
has its corresponding one on the marble.
But the contents of the relative masses not
being determinable by a measured surface,
the artist, though he gives to his stone the
resemblance of the model, yet, as he only
depends on the precarious aid of his eye,
he shall never cease wavering, as to his doing
right or wrong, cutting too flat or too deep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor can he find lines to determine precisely
the outlines, or the Contour of the
inward parts, and the centre of his model,
in so fixed and unchangeable a manner, as
to enable him, exactly, to transfer the same
Contours upon his stone.</p>

<p>To all this add, that, if his work happens
to be too voluminous for one single
hand, he must trust to those of his journeymen
and disciples, who, too often, are neither
skilful nor cautious enough to follow
their master’s design; and if once the smallest
trifle be cut wrong, for it is impossible to
fix, by this method, the limits of the cuts,
all is lost.</p>

<p>It is to be remarked in general, that
every sculptor, who carries on his chisselings
their whole length, on first fashioning his
marble, and does not prepare them by gradual
cuts for the last final strokes; it is to
be remarked, I say, that he never can keep
his work free from faults.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Another chief defect in that method is
this: the artist cannot help cutting off, every
moment, the lines on his block; and though
he restore them, cannot possibly be sure of
avoiding mistakes.</p>

<p>On account of this unavoidable uncertainty,
the artists found themselves obliged
to contrive another method, and that which
the French academy at Rome first made use
of for copying antiques, was applied by
many even to modelled performances.</p>

<p>Over the statue which you want to copy,
you fix a well-proportioned square, dividing
it into equally distant degrees, by
plummets: by these the outlines of the
figure are more distinctly marked than they
could possibly be by means of the former
method: they moreover afford the artist an
exact measure of the more prominent or
lower parts, by the degrees in which these
parts are near them, and in short, allow him
to go on with more confidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>But the undulations of a curve being not
determinable by a single perpendicular, the
Contours of the figure are but indifferently
indicated to the artist; and among their
many declinations from a straight surface,
his tenour is every moment lost.</p>

<p>The difficulty of discovering the real proportions
of the figures, may also be easily
imagined: they seek them by horizontals
placed across the plummets. But the rays
reflected from the figure through the squares,
will strike the eye in enlarged angles, and
consequently appear bigger, in proportion as
they are high or low to the point of view.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as the ancient monuments
must be most cautiously dealt with, plummets
are still of use in copying them, as no
surer or easier method has been discovered:
but for performances to be done from models
they are unfit for want of precision.</p>

<p><i>Michael Angelo</i> went alone a way unknown
before him, and (strange to tell!)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
untrod since the time of that genius of modern
sculpture.</p>

<p>This Phidias of latter times, and next to
the Greeks, hath, in all probability, hit the
very mark of his great masters. We know
at least no method so eminently proper for
expressing on the block every, even the minutest,
beauty of the model.</p>

<p><i>Vasari</i><a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> seems to give but a defective
description of this method, viz. <i>Michael<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Angelo</i> took a vessel filled with water, in
which he placed his model of wax, or some
such indissoluble matter: then, by degrees,
raised it to the surface of the water. In this
manner the prominent parts were unwet,
the lower covered, ’till the whole at length
appeared. Thus says <i>Vasari</i>, he cut his
marble, proceeding from the more prominent
parts to the lower ones.</p>

<p><i>Vasari</i>, it seems, either mistook something
in the management of his friend, or by the
negligence of his account gives us room to
imagine it somewhat different from what he
relates.</p>

<p>The form of the vessel is not determined;
to raise the figure from below would prove
too troublesome, and presupposes much more
than this historian had a mind to inform us
of.</p>

<p><i>Michael Angelo</i>, no doubt, thoroughly examined
his invention, its conveniencies and
inconveniencies, and in all probability observed
the following method.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>He took a vessel proportioned to his model;
for instance, an oblong square: he
marked the surface of its sides with certain
dimensions, and these he transferred afterwards,
with regular gradations, on the marble.
The inside of the vessel he marked
to the bottom with degrees. Then he laid,
or, if of wax, fastened his model in it; he
drew, perhaps, a bar over the vessel suitable
to its dimensions, according to whose number
he drew, first, lines on his marble, and
immediately after, the figure; he poured water
on the model till it reached its outmost
points, and after having fixed upon a prominent
part, he drew off as much water as
hindered him from seeing it, and then went
to work with his chissel, the degrees shewing
him how to go on; if, at the same time,
some other part of the model appeared, it
was copied too, as far as seen.</p>

<p>Water was again carried off, in order to
let the lower parts appear; by the degrees
he saw to what pitch it was reduced, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
by its smoothness he discovered the exact
surfaces of the lower parts; nor could he go
wrong, having the same number of degrees
to guide him, upon his marble.</p>

<p>The water not only pointed him out the
heights or depths, but also the Contour of
his model; and the space left free on the
insides to the surface of the water, whose
largeness was determined by the degrees of
the two other sides, was the exact measure
of what might safely be cut down from the
block.</p>

<p>His work had now got the first form, and
a correct one: the levelness of the water
had drawn a line, of which every prominence
of the mass was a point; according
to the diminution of the water the line sunk
in a horizontal direction, and was followed by
the artist ’till he discovered the declinations
of the prominences, and their mingling with
the lower parts. Proceeding thus with every
degree, as it appeared, he finished the Contour,
and took his model out of the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>His figure wanted beauty: he again poured
water to a proper height over his model,
and then numbering the degrees to the line
described by the water, he descried the exact
height of the protuberant parts; on these
he levelled his rule, and took the measure
of the distance, from its verge to the bottom;
and then comparing all he had done
with his marble, and finding the same number
of degrees, he was geometrically sure of
success.</p>

<p>Repeating his task, he attempted to express
the motion and re-action of nerves and
muscles, the soft undulations of the smaller
parts, and every imitable beauty of his model.
The water insinuating itself, even into
the most inaccessible parts, traced their Contour
with the correctest sharpness and precision.</p>

<p>This method admits of every possible
posture. In profile especially, it discovers
every inadvertency; shews the Contour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the prominent and lower parts, and the
whole diameter.</p>

<p>All this, and the hope of success, presupposes
a model formed by skilful hands,
in the true taste of antiquity.</p>

<p>This is the way by which <i>Michael Angelo</i>
arrived at immortality. Fame and rewards
conspired to procure him what leisure
he wanted, for performances which required
so much care.</p>

<p>But the artist of our days, however endowed
by nature and industry with talents
to raise himself, and even though he perceive
precision and truth in this method, is
forced to exert his abilities for getting bread
rather than honour: he of course rests in
his usual sphere, and continues to trust in an
eye directed by years and practice.</p>

<p>Now this eye, by the observations of which
he is chiefly ruled, being at last, though by
a great deal of uncertain practice, become
almost decisive: how refined, how exact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
might it not have been, if, from early youth,
acquainted with never-changing rules!</p>

<p>And were young artists, at their first beginning
to shape the clay or form the wax,
so happy as to be instructed in this sure method
of <i>Michael Angelo</i>, which was the fruit
of long researches, they might with reason
hope to come as near the Greeks as he did.</p>

<h3>VI. <span class="smcap">Painting.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">Greek Painting perhaps would share
all the praises bestowed on their Sculpture,
had time and the barbarity of mankind
allowed us to be decisive on that
point.</p>

<p>All the Greek painters are allowed is
Contour and Expression. Perspective, Composition,
and Colouring, are denied them; a
judgment founded on some bas-reliefs, and
the new-discovered ancient (for we dare not
say Greek) pictures, at and near Rome, in
the subterranean vaults of the palaces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Mæcenas, Titus, Trajan, and the Antonini;
of which but about thirty are preserved entire,
some being only in Mosaic.</p>

<p><i>Turnbull</i>, to his treatise on ancient painting,
has subjoined a collection of the most
known ancient pictures, drawn by <i>Camillo
Paderni</i>, and engraved by <i>Mynde</i>; and these
alone give some value to the magnificent
and abused paper of his work. Two of
them are copied from originals in the cabinet
of the late Dr. <i>Mead</i>.</p>

<p>That <i>Poussin</i> much studied the pretended
<i>Aldrovandine</i> Nuptials; that drawings are
found done by <i>Annibal Carracci</i>, from the
presumed <i>Marcius Coriolanus</i>; and that there
is a most striking resemblance between the
heads of <i>Guido</i>, and those on the Mosaic representing
<i>Jupiter</i> carrying off <i>Europa</i>, are
remarks long since made.</p>

<p>Indeed, if ancient Painting were to be
judged by these, and such like remains of
<i>Fresco</i> pictures, Contour and Expression might
be wrested from it in the same manner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
For the pictures, with figures as big as life,
pulled off with the walls of the Herculanean
theatre, afford but a very poor idea of
the Contour and Expression of the ancient
painters. Theseus, the conqueror of the
Minotaur, worshipped by the Athenian
youths; Flora with Hercules and a Faunus;
the pretended judgment of the Decemvir
Appius Claudius, are on the testimony of an
artist who saw them, of a Contour as mean
as faulty; and the heads want not only Expression,
but those in the Claudius even
Character.</p>

<p>But even this is an evident instance of the
meanness of the artists: for the science of
beautiful Proportions, of Contour, and Expression,
could not be the exclusive privilege
of Greek sculptors alone.</p>

<p>However, though I am for doing justice
to the ancients, I have no intention to lessen
the merit of the moderns.</p>

<p>In Perspective there is no comparison between
them and the ancients, whom no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
earned defence can intitle to any superiority
in that science. The laws of Composition
and Ordonnance seem to have been but imperfectly
known by the ancients: the reliefs
of the times when the Greek arts were
flourishing at Rome, are instances of this.
The accounts of the ancient writers, and the
remains of Painting are likewise, in point of
Colouring, decisive in favour of the moderns.</p>

<p>There are several other objects of Paintings
which, in modern times, have attained
greater perfection: such are landscapes and
cattle pieces. The ancients seem not to
have been acquainted with the handsomer
varieties of different animals in different
climes, if we may conclude from the horse
of M. Aurelius; the two horses in Monte
Cavallo; the pretended Lysippean horses
above the portal of St. Mark’s church at
Venice; the Farnesian bull, and other animals
of that groupe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>I observe, by the bye, that the ancients
were careless of giving to their horses the
diametrical motion of their legs; as we see
in the horses at Venice, and the ancient
coins: and in that they have been followed,
nay even defended, by some ignorant moderns.</p>

<p>’Tis chiefly to oil-painting that our landscapes,
and especially those of the Dutch,
owe their beauties: by that their colours acquired
more strength and liveliness; and even
nature herself seems to have given them a
thicker, moister atmosphere, as an advantage
to this branch of the art.</p>

<p>These, and some other advantages over
the ancients, deserve to be set forth with
more solid arguments than we have hitherto
had.</p>

<h3>VII. <span class="smcap">Allegory.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">There is one other important step
left towards the atchievement of the
art: but the artist, who, boldly forsaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the common path, dares to attempt it, finds
himself at once on the brink of a precipice,
and starts back dismayed.</p>

<p>The stories of martyrs and saints, fables
and metamorphoses, are almost the only
objects of modern painters—repeated a thousand
times, and varied almost beyond the
limits of possibility, every tolerable judge
grows sick at them.</p>

<p>The judicious artist falls asleep over a
Daphne and Apollo, a Proserpine carried
off by Pluto, an Europa, &amp;c. he wishes for
occasions to shew himself a poet, to produce
significant images, to paint Allegory.</p>

<p>Painting goes beyond the senses: <i>there</i> is
its most elevated pitch, to which the Greeks
strove to raise themselves, as their writings
evince. Parrhasius, like Aristides, a painter
of the soul, was able to express the character
even of a whole people: he painted
the Athenians as mild as cruel, as fickle as
steady, as brave as timid. Such a representation
owes its possibility only to the allegorical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
method, whose images convey general
ideas.</p>

<p>But here the artist is lost in a desart.
Tongues the most savage, which are entirely
destitute of abstracted ideas, containing no
word whose sense could express memory,
space, duration, &amp;c. these tongues, I say,
are not more destitute of general signs,
than painting in our days. The painter
who thinks beyond his palette longs for
some learned apparatus, by whose stores he
might be enabled to invest abstracted ideas
with sensible and meaning images. Nothing
has yet been published of this kind, to
satisfy a rational being; the essays hitherto
made are not considerable, and far beneath
this great design. The artist himself knows
best in what degree he is satisfied with
Ripa’s Iconology, and the emblems of ancient
nations, by Van Hooghe.</p>

<p>Hence the greatest artists have chosen but
vulgar objects. <i>Annibal Caracci</i>, instead of
representing in general symbols and sensible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
images the history of the Farnesian family,
as an allegorical poet, wasted all his skill in
fables known to the whole world.</p>

<p>Go, visit the galleries of monarchs, and
the publick repositories of art, and see what
difference there is between the number of
allegorical, poetical, or even historical performances,
and that of fables, saints, or
madonnas.</p>

<p>Among great artists, <i>Rubens</i> is the most
eminent, who first, like a sublime poet,
dared to attempt this untrodden path. His
most voluminous composition, the gallery of
Luxembourg, has been communicated to
the world by the hands of the best engravers.</p>

<p>After him the sublimest performance undertaken
and finished, in that kind, is, no
doubt, the cupola of the imperial library at
Vienna, painted by <i>Daniel Gran</i>, and engraved
by <i>Sedelmayer</i>. The Apotheosis of
Hercules at Versailles, done by <i>Le Moine</i>,
and alluding to the Cardinal <i>Hercules de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Fleury</i>, though deemed in France the most
august of compositions, is, in comparison of
the learned and ingenious performance of
the German artist, but a very mean and short-sighted
Allegory, resembling a panegyric, the
most striking beauties of which are relative to
the almanack. The artist had it in his power
to indulge grandeur, and his flipping the
occasion is astonishing: but even allowing,
that the Apotheosis of a minister was all
that he ought to have decked the chief
cieling of a royal palace with, we nevertheless
see through his fig-leaf.</p>

<p>The artist would require a work, containing
every image with which any abstracted idea
might be poetically inverted; a work collected
from all mythology, the best poets of all
ages, the mysterious philosophy of different
nations, the monuments of the ancients on
gems, coins, utensils, &amp;c. This magazine
should be distributed into several classes, and,
with proper applications to peculiar possible
cases, adapted to the instruction of the artist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
This would, at the same time, open a vast
field for imitating the ancients, and participating
of their sublimer taste.</p>

<p>The taste in our decorations, which, since
the complaints of <i>Vitruvius</i>, hath changed for
the worse, partly by the grotesques brought
in vogue by <i>Morto da Feltro</i>, partly by our
trifling house-painting, might also, from
more intimacy with the ancients, reap the
advantages of reality and common sense.</p>

<p>The Caricatura-carvings, and favourite
shells, those chief supports of our ornaments,
are full as unnatural as the candle-sticks
of <i>Vitruvius</i>, with their little castles
and palaces: how easy would it be, by the
help of Allegory, to give some learned convenience
to the smallest ornament!</p>

<p class="noindent">Paintings of ceilings, doors, and chimney-pieces,

all over. Not only they have not the least
relation to the rank and circumstances of the
proprietor, but often throw some ridicule or
reflection upon him.</p>

<p>’Tis an abhorrence of barrenness that fills
walls and rooms; and pictures void of
thought must supply the vacuum.</p>

<p>Hence the artist, abandoned to the dictates
of his own fancy, paints, for want of Allegory,
perhaps a satire on him to whom
he owes his industry; or, to shun this Charybdis,
finds himself reduced to paint figures
void of any meaning.</p>

<p>Nay, he may often find it difficult to
meet even with those, ’till at last</p>

<p class="noindent">Thus Painting is degraded from its most
eminent prerogative, the representation of
invisible, past and future things.</p>

<p>If pictures be sometimes met with, which
might be significant in some particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
place, they often lose that property by stupid
and wrong applications.</p>

<p>Perhaps the master of some new building</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Dives agris, dives positis in fœnore nummis</i></div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">may, without the least compunction for offending
the rules of perspective, place figures
of the smallest size above the vast doors of
his apartments and salloons. I speak here of
those ornaments which make part of the
furniture; not of figures which are often,
and for good reasons, set up promiscuously
in collections.</p>

<p>The decorations of architecture are often
as ill-chosen. Arms and trophies deck a
hunting-house as nonsensically, as Ganymede
and the eagle, Jupiter and Leda,
figure it among the reliefs of the brazen
gates of St. Peter’s church at Rome.</p>

<p>Arts have a double aim: to delight and
to instruct. Hence the greatest landscape-painters
think, they have fulfilled but half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
their task in drawing their pieces without
figures.</p>

<p>Let the artist’s pencil, like the pen of
Aristotle, be impregnated with reason; that,
after having satiated the eye, he may nourish
the mind: and this he may obtain by
Allegory; investing, not hiding his ideas.
Then, whether he chuse some poetical
object himself, or follow the dictates of
others, he shall be inspired by his art, shall
be fired with the flame brought down from
heaven by Prometheus, shall entertain the
votary of art, and instruct the mere lover
of it.</p>

<p class="noindent">SIR,</p>

<p class="dropcap">As you have written on the Greek arts
and artists, I wish you had made your
treatise as much the object of your caution
as the Greek artists made their works;
which, before dismissing them, they exhibited
to publick view, in order to be examined by
everybody, and especially by competent judges
of the art. The trial was held during the
grand, chiefly the Olympian, games; and all
Greece was interested on Ætion’s producing
his picture of the nuptials of Alexander and
Roxana. You, Sir, wanted a Proxenidas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
to be judged by, as well as that artist; and
had it not been for your mysterious concealment,
I might have communicated your
treatise, before its publication, to some learned
men and connoisseurs of my acquaintance,
without mentioning the author’s name.</p>

<p>One of them visited Italy twice, where
he devoted all his time to a most anxious
examination of painting, and particularly
several months to each eminent picture, at
the very place where it was painted; the
only method, you know, to form a connoisseur.
The judgment of a man able to
tell you which of Guido’s altar-pieces is
painted on taffeta, or linnen, what sort of
wood Raphael chose for his transfiguration,
&amp;c. the judgment of such a man, I fancy,
must be allowed to be decisive.</p>

<p>Another of my acquaintance has studied
antiquity: he knows it by the very smell;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Callet &amp; Artificem solo deprendere Odore.</i></div>
<div class="attr">Sectan. Sat.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">He can tell you the number of knots on
Hercules’s club; has reduced Nestor’s goblet
to the modern measure: nay, is suspected of
meditating solutions to all the questions proposed
by Tiberius to the grammarians.</p>

<p>A third, for several years past, has neglected
every thing but hunting after ancient
coins. Many a new discovery we owe to
him; especially some concerning the history
of the ancient coiners; and, as I am told, he
is to rouse the attention of the world by a Prodromus
concerning the coiners of Cyzicum.</p>

<p>What a number of reproaches might you
have escaped, had you submitted your Essay
to the judgment of these gentlemen! they were
pleased to acquaint me with their objections,
and I should be sorry, for your honour, to
see them published.</p>

<p>Among other objections, the first is surprized
at your passing by the two Angels, in
your description of the Raphael in the royal
cabinet at Dresden; having been told, that a
Bolognese painter, in mentioning this piece,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
which he saw at St. Sixtus’s at Piacenza,
breaks into these terms of admiration: O!
what Angels of Paradise<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>! by which he
supposes those Angels to be the most beautiful
figures of the picture.</p>

<p>The same person would reproach you for
having described that picture in the manner
of Raguenet<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.</p>

<p>The second concludes the beard of Laocoon
to be as worthy of your attention as
his contracted belly: for every admirer of
Greek works, says he, must pay the same
respect to the beard of Laocoon, which father
Labat paid to that of the Moses of Michael
Angelo.</p>

<p>This learned Dominican,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Qui mores hominum multorum vidit &amp; urbes</i>,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">has, after so many centuries, drawn from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
this very statue an evident proof of the true
fashion in which Moses wore his own individual
beard, and whose imitation must, of
course, be the distinguishing mark of every
true Jew<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.</p>

<p>There is not the least spark of learning,
says he, in your remarks on the Peplon of
the three vestals: he might perhaps, on the
very inflection of the veil, have discovered
to you as many curiosities as Cuper himself
found on the edge of the veil of Tragedy
in the Apotheosis of Homer<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.</p>

<p>We also want proof of the vestals being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
really Greek performances: our reason fails
us too often in the most obvious things. If
unhappily the marble of these figures should
be proved to be no Lychnites, they are lost,
and your treatise too: had you but slightly
told us their marble was large-grained, that
would have been a sufficient proof of their
authenticity; for it would be somewhat difficult
to determine the bigness of the grains
with such exactness as to distinguish the
Greek marble from the Roman of Luna.
But the worst is, they are even denied the
title of vestals.</p>

<p>The third mentioned some heads of Livia
and Agrippina, without that pretended profile
of yours. Here he thinks you had the
most lucky occasion to talk of that kind of
nose by the ancients called <i>Quadrata</i>, as an
ingredient of beauty. But you no doubt
know, that the noses of some of the most
famous Greek statues, viz. the Medicean
Venus, and the Picchinian Meleager, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
much too thick for becoming the model of
beauty, in that kind, to our artists.</p>

<p>I shall not, however, gall you with all
the doubts and objections raised against your
treatise, and repeated to nauseousness, upon
the arrival of an Academician, the Margites
of our days, who, being shewed your treatise,
gave it a slight glance, then laid it aside,
offended as it were at first sight. But it was
easy to perceive that he wanted his opinion
to be asked, which we accordingly all did.
“The author, said he very peremptorily,
seems not to have been at much pains with
this treatise: I cannot find above four or five
quotations, and those negligently inserted;
no chapter, no page, cited; he certainly collected
his remarks from books which he is
ashamed to produce.”</p>

<p>Yet cannot I help introducing another
gentleman, sharp-sighted enough to pick
out something that had escaped all my attention;
viz. that the Greeks were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
first inventors of Painting and Sculpture; an
assertion, as he was pleased to express himself,
entirely false, having been told it was
the Egyptians, or some people still more ancient,
and unknown to him.</p>

<p>Even the most whimsical humour may be
turned to profit: nevertheless, I think it
manifest that you intended to talk only of
good Taste in those arts; and the first Elements
of an art have the same proportion to
good Taste in it, as the seed has to the
fruit. That the art was still in its infancy
among the Egyptians, when it had attained
the highest degree of perfection among the
Greeks, may be seen by examining one
single gem: you need only consider the head
of <i>Ptolomæus Philopator</i> by Aulus, and the
two figures adjoining to it done by an
Egyptian<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>, in order to be convinced of the
little merit this nation could pretend to in
point of art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>The form and taste of their Painting have
been ascertained by Middleton.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The
pictures of persons as big as life, on two
mummies in the royal cabinet of antiquities
at Dresden, are evident instances of their incapacity.
But these relicks being curious,
in several other respects, I shall hereafter
subjoin a short account of them.</p>

<p>I cannot, my friend, help allowing some
reason for several of these objections. Your
negligence in your quotations was, no doubt,
somewhat prejudicial to your authenticity:
the art of changing blue eyes to black ones,
certainly deserved an authority. You imitate
Democritus; who being asked, “What
is man?” every body knows what was his
reply. What reasonable creature will submit
to read all Greek scholiasts!</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Considering, however, how easily the human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
mind is biassed, either by friendship
or animosity, I took occasion from these objections
to examine your treatise with more
exactness; and shall now, by the most impartial
censure, strive to clear myself from
every imputation of prepossession in your
favour.</p>

<p>I will pass by the first and second page,
though something might be said on your
comparison of the Diana with the Nausicaa,
and the application: nor would it have been
amiss, had you thrown some more light on the
remark concerning the misused pictures of
Corregio (very likely borrowed from Count
Tessin’s letters), by giving an account of the
other indignities which the pictures of the
best artists, at the same time, met with at
Stockholm.</p>

<p>It is well known that, after the surrender
of Prague to Count Konigsmark, the 15th
of July 1648, the most precious pictures of
the Emperor Rodolph II. were carried off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to Sweden<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>. Among these were some pictures
of Corregio, which the Emperor had
been presented with by their first possessor,
Duke Frederick of Mantua; two of them being
the famous Leda, and a Cupid handling
his bow<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>. Christina, endowed at that time
rather with scholastic learning than taste,
treated these treasures as the Emperor Claudius
did an Alexander of Apelles; who ordered
the head to be cut off, and that of
Augustus to fill its place<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>. In the same
manner heads, hands, feet were here cut
off from the most beautiful pictures; a carpet
was plastered over with them, and the
mangled pieces fitted up with new heads,
&amp;c. Those that fortunately escaped the
common havock, among which were the
pieces of Corregio, came afterwards, together
with several other pictures, bought by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the Queen at Rome, into the possession of
the Duke of Orleans, who purchased 250
of them, and among those eleven of Corregio,
for 9000 Roman crowns.</p>

<p>But I am not contented with your charging
only the northern countries with barbarism,
on account of the little esteem they
paid to the arts. If good taste is to be judged
in this manner, I am afraid for our French
neighbours. For having taken Bonn, the
residence of the Elector of Cologne, after
the death of Max. Henry, they ordered the
largest pictures to be cut out of their frames,
without distinction, in order to serve for coverings
to the waggons, in which the most
valuable furniture of the electoral castle was
carried off for France. But, Sir, do not
presume on my continuing with mere historical
remarks: I shall proceed with my objections;
after making the two following general
observations.</p>

<p>I. You have written in a style too concise
for being distinct. Were you afraid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
being condemned to the penalty of a
Spartan, who could not restrain himself to
only three words, perhaps that of reading
Picciardin’s Pisan War? Distinctness is required
where universal instruction is the end.
Meats are to suit the taste of the guests,
rather than that of the cooks,</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>II. There appears, in almost every line of
yours, the most passionate attachment to
antiquity; which perhaps I shall convince
you of, by the following remarks.</p>

<p>The first particular objection I have to
make is against your third page. Remember,
however, that my passing by two
pages is very generous dealing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse indent5"><i>non temere a me</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Quivis ferret idem:</i></div>
<div class="attr">Hor.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">but let us now begin a formal trial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>The author talks of certain negligences in
the Greek works, which ought to be considered
suitably to Lucian’s precepts concerning
the Zeus of Phidias: “Zeus himself,
not his footstool;”<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> though perhaps he could
not be charged with any fault in the foot-stool,
but with a very grievous one in the statue.</p>

<p>Is it no fault that Phidias made his Zeus
of so enormous a bulk, as almost to reach
the cieling of the temple, which must infallibly
have been thrown down, had the
god taken it in his head to rise?<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> To have
left the temple without any cieling at all,
like that of the Olympian Jupiter at Athens,
had been an instance of more judgment<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.</p>

<p>’Tis but justice to claim an explication of
what the author means by “negligences”.
He perhaps might be pleased to get a passport,
even for the faults of the ancients,
by sheltering them under the authority of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
such titles; nay, to change them into beauties,
as Alcæus did the spot on the finger of
his beloved boy. We too often view the
blemishes of the ancients, as a parent does
those of his children:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent9"><i>Strabonem</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Appellat pætum pater, &amp; pullum, male parvus</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Si cui filius est.</i></div>
<div class="attr">Hor.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">If these negligences were like those wished
for in the Jalysus of Protogenes, where the
chief figure was out-shone by a partridge,
they might be considered as the agreeable negligée
of a fine lady; but this is the question.
Besides, had the author consulted his interest,
he never would have ventured citing
the Diomedes of Dioscorides: but being too
well acquainted with that gem, one of the
most valued, most finished monuments of
Greek art; and being apprehensive of the
prejudice that might arise against the meaner
productions of the ancients, on discovering
many faults in one so eminent as Diomedes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
he endeavoured to keep matters from being
too nearly examined, and to soften every
fault into negligence.</p>

<p>How! if by argument I shall attempt to
shew that Dioscorides understood neither
perspective, nor the most trivial rules of the
motion of a human body; nay, that he offended
even against possibility? I’ll venture
to do it, though</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent5"><i>incedo per ignes</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Suppositos cineri doloso.</i></div>
<div class="attr">Hor.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And perhaps I am not the first discoverer of
his faults: yet I do not remember to have
seen any thing relative to them.</p>

<p>The Diomedes of Dioscorides is either a
sitting, or a rising figure; for the attitude is
ambiguous. It is plain he is not sitting;
and rising is inconsistent with his action.</p>

<p>Our body endeavouring to raise itself from
a seat, moves always mechanically towards
its sought-for centre of gravity, drawing back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the legs, which were advanced in sitting<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>;
instead of which the figure stretches out his
right leg. Every erection begins with elevated
heels, and in that moment all the
weight of the body is supported only by the
toes, which was observed by Felix<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>, in his
Diomedes: but here all rests on the sole.</p>

<p>Nor can Diomedes, (if we suppose him
to be a sitting figure, as he touches with his
left leg the bottom of his thigh) find, in
raising himself, the centre of his gravity,
only by a retraction of his legs, and of
course cannot rise in that posture. His left
hand resting upon the bended leg, holds the
palladion, whilst his right touches negligently
the pedestal with the point of a short
sword; consequently he cannot rise, neither
moving his legs in the natural and easy
manner required in any erection, nor making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
use of his arms to deliver himself from that
uneasy situation.</p>

<p>There is at the same time a fault committed
against the rules of perspective.</p>

<p>The foot of the left bended leg, touching
the cornice of the pedestal, shews it
over-reaching that part of the floor, on which
the pedestal and the right foot are situated,
consequently the line described by the hinder-foot
is the fore on the gem, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>But allowing even a possibility to that
situation, it is contrary to the Greek character,
which is always distinguished by the
natural and easy. Attributes neither to be
met with in the contortions of Diomedes,
nor in an attitude, the impossibility of which
every one must be sensible of, in endeavouring
to put himself in it, without the help
of former sitting.</p>

<p>Felix, supposed to have lived after Dioscorides,
though preserving the same attitude,
has endeavoured to make its violence more
natural, by opposing to him the figure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Ulysses, who, as we are told, in order to
bereave him of the honour of having seized
the Palladion, offered to rob him of it, but
being discovered, was repulsed by Diomedes;
which being his supposed action on the gem,
allows violence of attitude<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.</p>

<p>Diomedes cannot be a sitting figure, for
the Contour of his buttock and thigh is
free, and not in the least compressed: the
foot of the bent leg is visible, and the leg
itself not bent enough.</p>

<p>The Diomedes represented by Mariette
is absurd; the left leg resembling a clasped
pocket-knife, and the foot being drawn up
so high as to make it impossible in nature
that it should reach the pedestal<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.</p>

<p>Faults of this kind cannot be called negligences,
and would not be forgiven in any
modern artist.</p>

<p>Dioscorides, ’tis true, in this renowned
performance did but copy Polycletus, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Doryphorus (as is commonly agreed) was
the best rule of human proportions<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>. But,
though a copyist, Dioscorides escaped a fault
which his master fell into. For the pedestal,
over which the Diomedes of Polycletus
leans, is contrary to the most common
rules of perspective; its cornices, which
should be parallel, forming two different
lines.</p>

<p>I wonder at Perrault’s omitting to make
objections against the ancient gems.</p>

<p>I mean not to do any thing derogatory to
the author, when I trace some of his particular
observations to their source.</p>

<p>The food prescribed to the young wrestlers,
in the remoter times of Greece, is mentioned
by Pausanias<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>. But if the author alluded
to the passage which I have in view, why
does he talk in general of milk-food, when
Pausanias particularly mentions soft cheese?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Dromeus of Stymphilos, we learn there, first
introduced flesh meat.</p>

<p>My researches, concerning their mysterious
art of changing blue eyes to black ones,
have not succeeded to my wish. I find it
mentioned but once, and that only by the
bye by Dioscorides<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>. The author, by clearing
up this art, might perhaps have thrown
a greater lustre over his treatise, than by
producing his new method of statuary. He
had it in his power to fix the eyes of the
Newtons and Algarotti’s, on a problem worth
their attention, and to engage the fair sex,
by a discovery so advantageous to their charms,
especially in Germany, where, contrary to
Greece, large, fine, blue eyes are more frequently
met with than black ones.</p>

<p>There was a time when the fashion required
to be green eyed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Et si bel oeil vert &amp; riant &amp; clair:</i></div>
<div class="attr">Le Sire de Coucy, chans.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">But I do not know whether art had any
share in their colouring. And as to the small-pox,
Hippocrates might be quoted, if grammatical
disquisitions suited my purpose.</p>

<p>However, I think, no effects of the small-pox
on a face can be so much the reverse of
beauty, as that defect which the Athenians were
reproachfully charged with, viz. a buttock as
pitiful as their face was perfect<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>. Indeed
Nature, in so scantily supplying those parts,
seemed to derogate as much from the Athenian
beauty, as, by her lavishness, from that
of the Indian Enotocets, whose ears, we
are told, were large enough to serve them
for pillows.</p>

<p>As for opportunities to study the nudities,
our times, I think, afford as advantageous
ones as the Gymnasies of the ancients.
’Tis the fault of our artists to make no
use of that<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> proposed to the Parisian artists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
viz. to walk, during the summer season, along
the Seine, in order to have a full view of
the naked parts, from the sixth to the
fiftieth year.</p>

<p>’Tis perhaps to Michael Angelo’s frequenting
such opportunities that we owe his celebrated
Carton of the Pisan war<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>, where
the soldiers bathing in a river, at the sound
of a trumpet leap out of the water, and
make haste to huddle on their cloaths.</p>

<p>One of the most offensive passages of the
treatise is, no doubt, the unjust debasement
of the modern sculptors beneath the ancients.
These latter times are possessed of
several Glycons in muscular heroic figures,
and, in tender youthful female bodies, of
more than one Praxiteles. Michael Angelo,
Algardi, and Sluter, whose genius embellished
Berlin, produced muscular bodies,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">——<i>Invicti membra Glyconis,</i></div>
<div class="attr">Hor.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">in a style rivalling that of Glycon himself;
and in delicacy the Greeks are perhaps even
outdone by <i>Bernini</i>, <i>Fiammingo</i>, <i>Le Gros</i>,
<i>Rauchmüller</i>, <i>Donner</i>.</p>

<p>The unskilfulness of the ancients, in
shaping children, is agreed upon by our artists,
who, I suppose, would for imitation
choose a Cupid of Fiammingo rather than
of Praxiteles himself. The story of M. Angelo’s
placing a Cupid of his own by the side
of an antique one, in order to inform our
times of the superiority of the ancient art, is
of no weight here: for no work of Michael
Angelo can bring us so near perfection as
Nature herself.</p>

<p>I think it no hyperbole to advance, that
Fiammingo, like a new Prometheus, produced
creatures which art had never seen
before him. For, if from almost all
the children on ancient gems<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
reliefs<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>, we may form a conclusion of the art
itself, it wanted the true expression of childhood,
as looser forms, more milkiness, and
unknit bones. Faults which, from the epoch
of Raphael, all children laboured under, till
the appearance of <i>Francis Quesnoy</i>, called
Fiammingo, whose children having the advantages
of suitable innocence and nature,
became models to the following artists, as in
youthful bodies Apollo and Antinous are:
an honour which <i>Algardi</i>, his contemporary,
may be allowed to share.</p>

<p>Their models in clay are, by our artists,
esteemed superior to all the antique marble
children; and an artist of genius and talents
assured me, that during a stay of seven
years at Vienna, he saw not one copy taken
from an ancient Cupid in that academy.</p>

<p>Neither do I know on what singular idea
of beauty, the ancient artists founded their
custom, of hiding the foreheads of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
children and youths with hair. Thus a
Cupid was represented by Praxiteles<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>; thus
a Patroclus, in a picture mentioned by Philostratus<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>:
and there is no statue nor bust,
no gem nor coin of Antinous, in which we
do not find him thus dressed. Hence, perhaps,
that gloom, that melancholy, with
which all the heads of this favourite of Hadrian
are marked.</p>

<p>Is not there in a free open brow more
nobleness and sublimity? and does not
<i>Bernini</i> seem to have been better acquainted
with beauty than the ancients, when he removed
the over-shadowing locks from the
forehead of young Lewis XIV. whose bust
he was then executing? “Your Majesty,
said Bernini, is King, and may with confidence
shew your brow to all the world.”
From that time King and court dressed their
hair à la Bernini<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>His judgment of the bas-reliefs on the
monument of Pope Alexander VI<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>. leads us
to some remarks on those of antiquity.
“The skill in bas-relief, said he, consists
in giving the air of relief to the flat: the
figures of that monument seem what they
are indeed, not what they are not.”</p>

<p>The chief end of bas-relief is to deck
those places that want historical or allegorical
ornaments, but which have neither cornices
sufficiently spacious, nor proportions
regular enough to allow groupes of entire
statues: and as the cornice itself is chiefly
intended to shelter the subordinate parts from
being directly or indirectly hurt, no bas-relief
must exceed the projection thereof;
which would not only make the cornice of
no use, but endanger the figures themselves.</p>

<p>The figures of ancient bas-reliefs shoot
commonly so much forward as to become
almost round. But bas-relief being founded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
on fiction, can only counterfeit reality; its
perfection is well to imitate; and a natural
mass is against its nature: if flat, it ought to
appear projected, and <i>vice versa</i>. If this be
true, it must of course be allowed that
figures wholly round are inconsistent with it,
and are to be considered as solid marble
pillars built upon the theatre, whose aim is
mere illusion; for art, as is said of tragedy,
wins truth from fiction, and that by truth.
To art we often owe charms superior to
those of nature: a real garden and vegetating
trees, on the stage, do not affect us so agreeably,
as when well expressed by the imitating
art. A rose of <i>Van Huisum</i>, mallows of
<i>Veerendal</i>, bewitch us more than all the
darlings of the most skilful gardener: the
most enticing landscape, nay, even the
charms of the Thessalian Tempe, would not,
perhaps, affect us with that irresistible delight
which, flowing from <i>Dietrick</i>’s pencil,
enchants our senses and imagination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>By such instances we may safely form a
judgment of the ancient bas-reliefs: the
royal cabinet at Dresden is possessed of two
eminent ones: a Bacchanal on a tomb, and
a sacrifice to Priapus on a large marble
vase.</p>

<p>The bas-relief claims a particular kind
of sculpture; a method that few have succeeded
in, of which <i>Matielli</i> may be an instance.
The Emperor Charles VI. having
ordered some models to be prepared by the
most renowned artists, in bas-relief, intended
for the spiral columns at the church of
S. Charles Borromæo; <i>Matielli</i>, already famous,
was principally thought of; but however
refused the honour of so considerable a
work, on account of the enormous bulk of
his model, which requiring too great cavities,
would have diminished the mass of the
stone, and of course weakened the pillars.
<i>Mader</i> was the artist, whose models were
universally applauded, and who by his admirable
execution proved that he deserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
that preference. These bas-reliefs represent
the story of the patron of this church.</p>

<p>It is in general to be observed, first, that
this kind of sculpture admits not indifferently
of every attitude and action; as for instance,
of too strong projections of the legs. Secondly,
That, besides disposing of the several
modelled figures in well-ranged groupes, the
diameter of every one ought to be applied
to the bas-relief itself, by a lessened scale:
as for instance, the diameter of a figure in
the model being one foot, the profile of the
same, according to its size, will be three
inches, or less: the rounder a figure of that
diameter, the greater the skill. Commonly
the relief wants perspective, and thence arise
most of its faults.</p>

<p>Though I proposed to make only a few
remarks on the ancient bas-relief, I find
myself, like a certain ancient Rhetor, almost
under a necessity of being new-tuned. I
have strayed beyond my limits; though at
the same time I remembered that there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
law among commentators, to content themselves
with bare remarks on the contents of a
treatise: and also sensible that I am writing
a letter, not a book, I consider that I may
draw some instructions for my own use,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">——<i>ut vineta egomet cædam mea,</i></div>
<div class="attr">Hor.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">from some peoples impetuosity against the
author; who, because they are hired for it,
seem to think that writing is confined to
them alone.</p>

<p>The Romans, though they worshipped
the deity Terminus (the guardian God of limits
and borders in general; and, if it please
these gentlemen, of the limits in arts and
sciences too), allowed nevertheless an universal
unrestrained criticism: and the decisions
of some Greeks and Romans, in
matters of an art, which they did not
practise, seem nevertheless authentick to our
artists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor can I find, that the keeper of the
temple of peace at Rome, though possessed
of the register of the pictures there, pretended
to monopolize remarks and criticisms
upon them; Pliny having described most of
them.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Publica materies privati juris sit</i>—</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">’Tis to be wished, that, roused by a Pamphilus
and an Apelles, artists would take up
the pen themselves, in order to discover the
mysteries of the art to those that know how
to use them,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Two or three of these are to be commended;
the rest contented themselves with giving
some historical accounts of the fraternity.
But what could appear more auspicious
to the improvement of the art, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
by the remotest posterity, than the work
attempted by the united forces of the celebrated
Pietro da Cortona<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and Padre Ottonelli?
Nevertheless this same treatise, except
only a few historical remarks, and these too
to be met with in an hundred books, seems
good for nothing, but</p>

<p>How trivial, how mean are the great
<i>Poussin</i>’s reflexions on painting, published
by Bellori, and annexed to his life of that
artist<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>?</p>

<p>Another digression!—let me now again
resume the character of your Aristarchus.</p>

<p>You are bold enough to attack the authority
of <i>Bernini</i>, and to challenge a
man, the bare mention of whose name
would do honour to any treatise. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
<i>Bernini</i>, you ought to recollect, Sir, who
at the same age in which Michael Angelo
performed his <i>Studiolo</i><a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>, viz. in his eighteenth
year, produced his Daphne, as a convincing
instance of his intimacy with the ancients,
at an age in which perhaps the genius of
Raphael was yet labouring under darkness
and ignorance!</p>

<p><i>Bernini</i> was one of those favourites of
nature, who produce at the same time vernal
blossoms and autumnal fruits; and I
think it by no means probable, that his studying
nature in riper years misled either him
or his disciples. The smoothness of his flesh
was the result of that study, and imparted
to the marble the highest possible degree of
life and beauty. Indeed ’tis nature which
endows art with life, and “vivifies forms,”
as Socrates says<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>, and Clito the sculptor allows.
The great Lysippus, when asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
which of his ancestors he had chosen for
his master, replied, “None; but nature
alone.” It is not to be denied, that the too
close imitation of antiquity is very often apt
to lead us to a certain barrenness, unknown
to those who imitate nature: various herself,
nature teaches variety, and no votary
of her’s can be charged with a sameness:
whereas Guido, Le Brun, and some other
votaries of antiquity, repeated the same face
in many of their works. A certain ideal
beauty was become so familiar to them, as
to slide into their figures even against their
will.</p>

<p>But as for such an imitation of nature,
as is quite regardless of antiquity, I am
entirely of the author’s opinion; though I
should have chosen other artists as instances
of following nature in painting.</p>

<p><i>Jordans</i> certainly has not met with the regard
due to his merit; let me appeal to an
authority universally allowed. “There is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
says Mr. d’Argenville, more expression and
truth in Jordans, than even in Rubens.</p>

<p>“Truth is the basis and origin of perfection
and beauty; nothing, of any kind
whatever, can be beautiful or perfect,
without being truly what it ought to be,
without having all it ought to have.”</p>

<p>The solidity of this judgment presupposed,
<i>Jordans</i>, according to Rochefoucault’s
maxims, ought rather to be ranked among
the greatest originals, than among the mimicks
of common nature, where <i>Rembrandt</i>
may fill up his place, as <i>Raoux</i> or <i>Vatteau</i>
that of <i>Stella</i>; though all these painters do
nothing but what Euripides did before them;
they draw man <i>ad vivum</i>. There are no
trifles, no meannesses in the art, and if we
recollect of what use the <i>Caricatura</i> was to
Bernini, we should be cautious how we
pass judgment even on the Dutch forms.
That great genius, they say<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>, owed to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
monster of the art, a distinction for which
he was so eminent, the “Franchezza del
Tocco.” When I reflect on this, I am forced
to alter my former opinion of the <i>Caricatura</i>,
so far as to believe that no artist ever
acquired a perfection therein without gaining
a farther improvement in the art itself. “It
is, says the author, a peculiar distinction of
the ancients to have gone beyond nature:”
our artists do the same in their <i>Caricaturas</i>:
but of what avail to them are the voluminous
works they have published on that branch
of the art?</p>

<p>The author lays it down, in the peremptory
style of a legislator, that “Precision
of Contour can only be learned from
the Greeks:” but our academies unanimously
agree, that the ancients deviate from
a strict Contour in the clavicles, arms, knees,
&amp;c. over which, in spite of apophyses and
bones, they drew their skin as smooth as
over mere flesh; whereas our academies
teach to draw the bony and cartilaginous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
parts, more angularly, but the fat and fleshy
ones more smooth, and carefully to avoid
falling into the ancient style. Pray, Sir, can
there be any error in the advices of academies
<i>in corpore</i>?</p>

<p><i>Parrhasius</i> himself, the father of Contour,
was not, by Pliny’s account<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>, master enough
to hit the line by which completeness is distinguished
from superfluity: shunning corpulency
he fell into leanness: and <i>Zeuxis</i>’s
Contour was perhaps like that of Rubens, if
it be true that, to augment the majesty of
his figures, he drew with more completeness.
His female figures he drew like those
of Homer<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>, of robust limbs: and does not
even the tenderest of poets, Theocritus, draw
his Helen as fleshy and tall<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> as the Venus
of Raphael in the assembly of the gods in
the little Farnese? Rubens then, for painting
like Homer and Theocritus, needs no apology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>The character of Raphael, in the treatise,
is drawn with truth and exactness: but well
may we ask the author, as Antalcidas the
Spartan asked a sophist, ready to burst forth
in a panegyrick on Hercules, “Who blames
him?” The beauties however of the Raphael
at Dresden, especially the pretended
ones of the Jesus, are still warmly disputed.</p>

worth their weight in gold, are the
ornaments of royal cabinets only, has made
nature inimitable to every Italian pencil; he
allures the connoisseur’s eye as well as that
of the clown; and, as an English poet says,
“that no pleasing poet ever wrote ill,”
surely the Flemish painter obtained that applause
which was denied to Poussin.</p>

<p>I should be glad to see many pictures as
happily fancied, as well composed, as enticingly
painted as some of <i>Gherard Lairesse</i>:
let me appeal to every unprepossessed artist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
at Paris, acquainted with the <i>Stratonice</i>,
the most eminent, and no doubt the first
ranked picture in the cabinet of Mr. de la
Boixieres<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.</p>

<p>The subject is of no trivial choice: King
Seleucus I.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> resigned his wife Stratonice, a
daughter of Demetrius Poliorcetes, to his son
Antiochus, whom a violent passion for his
mother-in-law had thrown into a dangerous
sickness: after many unsuccessful inquiries,
the physician Erasistratus discovered the true
cause, and found that the only means of
restoring the prince’s health, was, the condescension
of the father to the love of his
son: the King resigned his Queen, and at
the same time declared Antiochus King of
the East.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Stratonice, the chief person, is the noblest
figure, a figure worthy Raphael himself.
The charming Queen,</p>

<p class="noindent">with slow and hesitating steps, approaches
the bed of her new lover; but still with the
countenance of a mother, or rather of a sacred
vestal. In the profile of her face you
may read shame mingled with gentle resignation
to the will of her lord. She has the
softness of her sex, the majesty of a queen,
an awful submission to the sacred ceremony,
and all the sageness required in so extraordinary
and delicate a situation. Dressed
with a masterly skill, the artist, from the
colour of her cloaths, may learn how to
paint the purple of the ancients; for it is
not generally known that it resembled fadeing,
ruddy, vine-leaves<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Behind her stands the King, dressed in a
darker habit, in order to give the more relief
to the Queen, to spare confusion to her,
shame to the Prince, and not to interrupt
his joy. Expectation and acquiescence are
blended in his face, which is taken from the
profile of his best coins.</p>

<p>The Prince, a beautiful half-naked youth,
sitting in his bed, has some resemblance of
his father; his pale face bears witness of the
fever, that lately had raged in his veins; but
fancy sees returning health, not shame, in
that soft-rising ruddiness diffused over his
cheeks.</p>

<p>The physician and priest Erasistratus, venerable
like the Calchas of Homer, standing
before the bed, is the only speaker, authorised
by the King, whose will he declares
to the Prince; and whilst, with one hand,
he leads the Queen to the embraces of her
lover, with the other he presents him with
the diadem. Joy and astonishment flash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
from the Prince’s face on the approach of
his Queen</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">——<i>darting all the soul in missive love</i>:</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">though nobly restrained by reverence, he
bends his head, and seems to comprise his
happiness in a single thought.</p>

<p>The characters indeed are distributed with
so much ingenuity, that they seem to give a
lustre and energy to each other.</p>

<p>The largest share of light is displayed
on Stratonice: she claims our first regard.
The priest, though in a weaker light, is
raised by his gesture: he is the speaker, and
around him reign solemn stillness and attention.</p>

<p>The Prince, the second person, has a
larger share of light; and though the artist,
led by his skill, chose rather to make a
beautiful Queen the chief support of his
groupe than a sick Prince, He nevertheless
maintains his due rank, and becomes the
most eminent person of the whole, by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
expression. His face contains the greatest
secrets of the art,</p>

<p class="noindent">Even those motions of the soul, which
otherwise seem opposite to each other,
mingle here with peaceful harmony; a
timid red spreading over his sickly face, announces
health, like the faint glimmerings
of the morn, which, though veiled by night,
announce the day, and even a bright one.</p>

<p>The genius and taste of the artist shines
forth in every part of his work: even the
vases are copied from the best antique ones;
the table before the bed, is, like Homer’s, of
ivory.</p>

<p>The distances behind the figures represent
a magnificent Greek building, whose
decorations seem allegorical. The roof of
a portal is supported by Cariatides embracing
each other, as images of the tender friendship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
between father and son, and alluding,
at the same time, to the nuptial ceremony.</p>

<p>Though faithful to history, the painter was
nevertheless a poet: in order to represent
some circumstances, he filled even the furniture
with sentiments. The Sphinxes by
the Prince’s bed allude to his problematic
sickness, the enquiries of Erasistratus, and
his sagacity in discovering its true cause.</p>

<p>I have been told that some young Italian
artists, when considering this picture, and
perceiving the Prince’s arm perhaps a trifle
too big, went off without enquiring into the
subject itself. Should even Minerva herself,
as she once did to Diomedes, attempt to deliver
some people from the mist they labour
under, by heaven! the attempt were vain!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>I have run into this long digression, in
order to throw some light on one of the first
productions of the art, which is nevertheless
but little known.</p>

<p>The idea of noble simplicity and sedate
grandeur in Raphael’s figures, might rather,
as two eminent authors express it<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>, be called
“still life.” It is indeed the standard of the
Greek art: however, indiscreetly commended
to young artists, it might beget as dangerous
consequences, as precepts of energetick conciseness
in the style; the direct method to
make it barren and unpleasing.</p>

<p>“In youths, says Cicero<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>, there must
be some superfluity, something to be taken
off: prematurity spoils the juices, and it
is easier to lop the young rank branches of
a vine, than to restore its vigour to a
worn out trunk.” Not to mention, that
figures wanting gesture would, by the bulk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of mankind, be received as a speech before
the Areopagites, where, by a severe law, the
speaker was forbid to raise any passions,
though ever so gentle<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>: nay, pictures of
this kind would be so many portraits of
young Spartans, who, with hands hid under
their coats, and down-cast eyes, stalk
forth in silent solemnity<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>.</p>

<p>Neither am I quite of the author’s opinion
with regard to allegory; the applying
of which would too frequently do in painting,
what was done in geometry by introducing
algebra: the one would soon be as
difficult as the other, and painting would
degenerate into Hieroglyphicks.</p>

<p>The author attempts, in vain, to persuade
us, that the majority of the Greeks thought
as the Egyptians. There was no more learning
in the painting of the platfond of the
temple of Juno at Samos, than in that of
the Farnese gallery. It represented the love-intrigues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
of Jupiter and Juno<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>: and, in
the front of a temple of Ceres at Eleusis,
there was nothing but representations of a
ceremony at the rites of that goddess<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.</p>

<p>How to represent abstract ideas I do not
yet distinctly conceive. There may be the
same difficulties which attend the endeavours
of representing to the senses a mathematical
point—perhaps nothing less than impossibility;
and Theodoretus<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> has some reason in
confining painting to the senses. For those
Hieroglyphicks which hint at abstract ideas,
in such a manner as to express, for instance<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>,
<i>youth</i> by the number XVI; <i>impossibility</i> by
two feet standing on water: those, I say,
are monograms, not images: to indulge
them in painting is fostering chimæras, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
adding to Chinese pictures Chinese explications.</p>

<p>An adversary of allegory believes that Parrhasius,
without any help from it, could represent
the contradictions in the character of
the Athenians; that he did it perhaps in several
pictures. Supposing which</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Et sapit, &amp; mecum facit, &amp; Jove judicat æquo.</i></div>
<div class="attr">Hor.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The sentence of death pronounced against the
leaders of the Athenian navy, after their
victory over the Spartans near the Arginuses,
afforded the artist a very sensible and rich
image, to represent the Athenians, at the
same time, merciful and cruel.</p>

<p>The famous Theramenes, one of the
leaders, accused his fellow-chieftains of having
neglected to gather and bury the bodies
of their slain countrymen: a charge sufficient
to rouse the rage of the mob against the
victors; only six of whom had returned to
Athens, the rest having declined the storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Theramenes harangued the people in the
most pathetick manner; intermixing his
speech with frequent pauses, in order to
give vent to the loud plaints of those who,
in the battle, had lost their parents or relations.
He, at the same time, produced a
man, who protested he had heard the last
words of the drowned, imprecating the publick
revenge on their leaders. In vain did
Socrates, then a member of the council,
with a few others, oppose the accusation:
the brave chieftains, instead of the honours
they hoped for, were condemned to die.
One of them was the only son of <i>Pericles</i>
and <i>Aspasia</i>.</p>

<p>Was it not in the power of Parrhasius,
who was then alive, to enlarge the meaning
of his picture beyond the extent of
bare history, only by drawing the true characters
of the authors of this scene, without
the least help from allegory? It would have
been in his power, had he lived in our days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Your pretensions concerning allegory seem
indeed as reasonable an imposition upon the
painter, as that of Columella upon his farmer;
who wished to find him a philosopher
like Democritus, Pythagoras, or Eudoxus<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>.</p>

<p>No better success, in my opinion, is to
be expected from applying allegory to decorations:
the author would, at least, meet
with as many difficulties as Virgil, when
hammering on the names of a Vibius Caudex,
Tanaquil Lucumo, or Decius Mus; to
fit them for his Hexameter.</p>

<p>Custom has given its sanction to the use
of shells in decorations: and is not there as
much nature in them as in the Corinthian
capital? You know its origin: a basket set
upon the tomb of a young Corinthian girl,
filled with some of her play-things, and covered
with a large brick, being overgrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
with the creeping branches of an acanthus,
which had taken root under it, was the
first occasion of forming that capital. <i>Callimachus</i><a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
the sculptor, surprized at the elegant
simplicity of that composition, took
thence a hint for enriching architecture with
a new order.</p>

<p>Thus this capital, destined to support all
the entablature of the column, is but a basket
of flowers; something so apparently inconsistent
with the ideas of architecture, that
there was no use made of it in the time of
Pericles: for Pocock<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> thinks it strange that
the temple of Minerva at Athens had Doric,
instead of Corinthian pillars. But time soon
changed this seeming oddity into nature;
the basket lost, by custom, all its former
offensiveness, and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">We acknowledge no Egyptian law to forbid
arbitrary ornaments; and so fond have
the artists of all ages been, both of the
growth and form of shells, as to change
even the chariot of Venus into an enormous
one. The ancile, that Palladium of the Romans,
was scooped into the form of a shell<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>:
we find them on antique lamps<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>. Nay, nature
herself seems to have produced their
immense variety, and marvellous sinuations,
for the benefit of the art.</p>

<p>I have no mind to plead the bad cause
of our unskilful decorators: only let me
adduce the arguments used by a whole tribe,
(if the artists will forgive the term), in order
to prove the reasonableness of their art.</p>

<p>The painters and sculptors of Paris, endeavouring
to deprive the decorators of the
title of artists, by alledging that they employed
neither their own intellectual faculties,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
nor those of the connoisseurs, upon
works not produced by nature, but rather
the offsprings of capricious art; the others
are said to have defended themselves in the
following manner: “We are the followers
of nature: like the bark of a tree, variously
carved, our decorations grow into
various forms: then art joins sportive nature,
and corrects her: we do what the
ancients did: consult their decorations.”</p>

<p>Variety is the great and only rule to which
decorators submit. Perceiving that there is
no perfect resemblance between two things
in nature, they likewise forsake it in their
decorations; and careless of anxious twining,
leave it to the parts themselves to find their
like, as the atoms of Epicurus did. This
liberty we owe to the very nation, which,
after having nobly exceeded all the narrow
bounds of social formalities, bestows so much
pains upon communicating her improvements
to her neighbours. This style in decorations
got the epithet of <i>Barroque</i> taste,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
derived from a word signifying pearls and
teeth of unequal size<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>.</p>

<p>Shells have at least as good a claim for
being admitted among our decorations, as
the heads of sheep and oxen. You know
that the ancients placed those heads, stript of
the skin, on the frizes, especially of the
Doric order, between the Triglyphs, or on
the Metopes. We even meet with them on
the Corinthian frise of an old temple of Vesta,
at Tivoli<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>; on tombs, as on one of the
Metellus-family near Rome, and another of
Munatius Plancus near Gaeta<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>; on vases,
as on a pair in the royal cabinet at Dresden.
Some modern artists, finding them perhaps
unbecoming, changed them into thunderbolts,
like Vignola, or to roses, like Palladio
and Scamozzi<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>We conclude from all this, that learning
never had, nor indeed ought to have, any
share in an art so nearly related to what we
call <i>Lusus Naturæ</i>.</p>

<p>Thus the ancients thought: for, pray,
what could be meant by a lizard on Mentor’s
cup?<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The</p>

<p class="noindent">make, to be sure, a lovely image amidst the
flowers of a Rachel Ruysch, but a very
poor figure on a cup. Of what mysterious
meaning are birds picking grapes from vines,
on an urn?<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Images, perhaps, as void of
sense, and as arbitrary, as the fable of Ganymede
embroidered on the mantle, which
Æneas presented to Cloanthus, as a reward
of his victory in the naval games<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>To conclude: is there any thing contradictory
between trophies and the hunting-house
of a Prince? Surely the author,
though so zealous a champion for the Greek
taste, cannot pretend to propose to us that
of King Philip and the Macedonians, who,
by the account of Pausanias<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>, did not erect
their own trophies. Diana perhaps, amidst
her nymphs and hunting-equipages,</p>

ACCOUNT<br />
<span class="smaller">OF A</span><br />
MUMMY,<br />
<span class="smaller">IN<br />
The Royal Cabinet of Antiquities at <span class="smcap">Dresden</span>.</span></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p class="dropcap">Among the Egyptian Mummies of
the royal cabinet, there are two preserved
perfectly entire, and not in the least
damaged, viz. the bodies of a man and
woman. The former, among all those
that were brought into, and publickly known
in Europe, is perhaps the only one of its
kind; on account of an inscription thereon,
which none of those who have written on
Mummies, except Della Valle alone, discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
on those bodies; and Kircher, among
all the drawings of Mummies communicated
to him, and published in his Oedipus,
has but one, (the same which Della Valle
had been possessed of,) with an inscription;
though his wooden cut<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> is as faulty as all
the copies made afterwards<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>. On that
Mummy there are these letters ΕΥ✠ΥΧΙ.</p>

<p>This same inscription is on the royal
Mummy, of which I propose to give a brief
account, and in examining which I have
employed all my attention, that I might be
certain of its being genuine, and not drawn
by a modern hand from the inscription of
Della Valle: for ’tis well known, that those
bodies frequently pass through the hands of
Jews. But the letters are evidently drawn
with the same blackish colour with which
the face, hands, and feet are stained. The
first letter on our Mummy has the form of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
a large Greek ϵ, expressed by Della Valle
with an E angular, the other not being
usual in printing-presses.</p>

<p>All the four Mummies of the royal cabinet
being bought at Rome, I proposed to
examine whether the Mummy with the inscription,
was that which Della Valle was
possessed of, and found that both the entire
royal Mummies were exact resemblances of
those described by him.</p>

<p>Both, besides the linnen bandages, of a
Barracan-texture, rolled innumerable times
around the bodies, are wrapt up in several
(and, according to an observation made in
England<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>, in three) kinds of coarser linnen;
which, by particular bandages of the girdle-kind,
is fastened in such a manner as to involve
even the smallest prominence of the
face. The first covering is a nice bit of
linnen, slightly tinged with a certain ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
much gilt, decked with various figures, and
with a painted one of the deceased.</p>

<p>On the Mummy marked with the inscription,
this figure represents a man, who
died in the flower of life, with a thin curled
beard, not as represented by Kircher, like
an old man with a long pointed one. The
colour of the face and hands is brown:
the head encircled with gilt diadems, marked
with the sockets of jewels. From the gold
chain, painted around the neck, a sort of
medal hangs down, marked with various
characters, crescents, &amp;c. and this over-reaches
the neck of a bird, that of a hawk perhaps, as
on the breasts of other Mummies<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>. In the
right hand of the figure is a dish filled with
a red stuff, which being like that used by
the sacrificers<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>, the deceased may be supposed
to have been a priest. The first and last
finger of the left hand have rings; and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the hand itself there is something round, of
a dark-brown colour; which, as Della Valle
pretends, is a well-known fruit. The feet
and legs are bare, with sandals; the strings
of which appearing between the great toes,
are, with a slip, fastened on the foot itself.</p>

<p>The inscription, above-mentioned, is beneath
the breast.</p>

<p>The second Mummy is the still more refined
figure of a young woman. Among
a great many medals, seemingly gilt, and
other figures, there are certain birds, and
quadrupeds something analogous to lions;
and towards the extremities of the body there
is an ox, perhaps an apis: Down from one
of the neck-chains hangs a gilt image of
the sun. She has ear-rings, and double
bracelets on both her arms: rings on each
hand, and on every finger of the left one,
but two on the first: whereas the right hand
has but two: with this hand she holds,
like Isis, a small gilt vessel, of the Greek
Spondeion-kind, which was a symbol of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
fertility of the Nile, when held by the goddess<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>.
In the left hand there is a sort of
fruit, like an ear of corn, of a greenish cast.
The leaden seals, mentioned by Della Valle,
still remain on the first Mummy.</p>

<p>Compare this description with that in his
travels<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>, and you’ll find the Mummies of
the royal cabinet to be the same with those,
which were taken out of a deep well or
cave, covered with sand, and sold to this
celebrated traveller by an Egyptian; and I
believe they were purchased from his heirs at
Rome, though in the manuscript catalogue,
joined to that cabinet of antiquities, there is
not the least hint of any such purchase.</p>

<p>I have no design to attempt an explication
of the ornaments and figures; some remarks
of that kind having already been
made by Della Valle. The following observations
concern only the inscription.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>The Egyptians, we know, employed a
double character in expressing themselves<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>,
the <i>sacred</i> and the <i>vulgar</i>: the first was
what is called hieroglyphick; the other
contained the characters of their national
language, and this is commonly said to be
lost. All we know is confined to the twenty-five
letters of their alphabet.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Della
Valle seems inclined to give an instance
of the contrary, in that inscription; which
Kircher, pushing his conjectures still farther,
endeavours to lay down as a foundation for
a new scheme of his; and to support it by
two other remains of the same kind. For,
he attempts to prove<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>, that the dialect was
the only difference between the old Egyptian
and Greek tongue. According to his talent
of finding what no body looks for, he
makes free with some ancient historical accounts;
upon which he obtrudes a fictitious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
sense, in order to make them tally with
his scheme.</p>

<p>Herodotus, according to him, tells us, that
King Psammetichus desired some Greeks,
who were perfect masters of their language,
to go over to Egypt, in order to instruct his
people in the purity of the tongue. Hence
he concludes, that there was but one language
in both countries. But that Greek
historian<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> gives an account entirely opposite:
he tells us, that Psammetichus, having received
some services from the Carians and
Ionians, permitted them to settle in Egypt,
for the instruction of youth in the Greek
language, in order to bring up interpreters.</p>

<p>There is no solidity in the rest of the Kircherian
arguments; such as those deduced
from the frequent voyages of the Greek
sages into Egypt, and the mutual commerce
between the two nations; which have not
even the strength of conjectures. For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
very skill of Democritus, in the sacred tongue
of the Babylonians and Egyptians<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>, proves
only, that the travelling sages learned the languages
of the nations they conversed with.</p>

<p>Nor does the testimony of Diodorus,
that Attica was originally an Egyptian colony<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>,
seem to be here of any weight.</p>

<p>The inscription of the Mummy might indeed
admit of Kircherian, or such like conjectures,
were the Mummy itself of the antiquity
pretended by Kircher. Cambyses,
the conqueror of Egypt, partly exiled, and
partly killed the priests; from which fact
Kircher confidently deduces as consequences,
the total abolition of the sacred rites, and
from that the ceasing to embalm bodies.
He again appeals to a passage of Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>,
which, upon his word alone, others have as
confidently quoted. Nay, a certain pedant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
went so far as to pretend, that the Egyptian
custom of painting their dead, upon the
varnished linnen of the Mummies, ceased
with the epoch of Cyrus<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>.</p>

<p>But Herodotus says not a word, either of
the total abolition of the sacred rites, or of
the abolition of the custom of preserving
the dead from putrefaction, after the
time of Cambyses; nor does Diodorus Siculus
give any such hint: we may, on the
contrary, from his account of the funeral rites
of the Egyptians, rather conclude, that this
custom prevailed even in his time; that is
to say, when Egypt was changed into a Roman
province.</p>

<p>Hence it cannot be demonstrated that
our Mummy was embalmed before the Persian
conquest.—But supposing it to be of
that date, is it a necessary consequence that
a body preserved in the Egyptian manner,
or even taken care of by their priests, should
be marked with Egyptian words?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps it is the body of some naturalised
Ionian or Carian. We know that Pythagoras
entered into the Egyptian confession;
nay, even consented to be circumcised<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>, in
order to shorten his way to the mysteries of
their priests. The Carians themselves observed
the sacred solemnities of Isis, and
even went so far in their superstition, as to
mangle their faces during the sacrifices offered
to that deity<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>.</p>

<p>Change the letter ι, in the inscription, into
the diphthong ει, and you have a Greek word:
such negligences are often to be met with in
Greek marbles<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>, and still more in Greek manuscripts;
and with the same termination
it is to be found on a gem, and signifies,
“FAREWELL”<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>, which was the usual
ejaculation addressed by the living to the deceased;
the same we meet with on ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
epitaphs<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>; public decrees<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>; and of letters
it was the final conclusion<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>.</p>

<p>There is on an ancient epitaph the word
ΕΥΨΥΧΙ<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>; the form of the Ψ on ancient
stones and manuscripts is exactly the same<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
with the third letter of ΕΥ✠ΥΧΙ, which
was perhaps confounded with it.</p>

<p>But supposing the Mummy to be of later
times, the adoption of a Greek word becomes
yet easier. The round form of the ϵ
might be something suspicious, with regard to
its pretended antiquity; that form being never
found on the gems or coins before Augustus<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>.
But this suspicion becomes of no
weight, by supposing that the Egyptians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
continued their embalming, even after the
time of that Emperor.</p>

<p>However, the word cannot be an Egyptian
one, being inconsistent with the remains
of that ancient tongue in the modern Coptick,
as well as with their manner of writing;
which was from the right to the left,
as the Etrurians did<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>; whereas the word in
question (like some Egyptian characters<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>,)
is traced from the left to the right. As for
the inscription discovered by Maillet<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>, no
interpreter has yet been found. The Grecians,
on the contrary, wrote in the occidental
manner, for six hundred years before
the christian æra, witness the Sigæan
inscription, which is said to be of that
date<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>.</p>

<p>What has been said relates also to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
inscription upon a piece of stone<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>, with
Egyptian figures, communicated to Kircher
by Carolo Vintimiglia, a Palerman patrician.
The letters ΙΤΙΨΙΧΙ are two words,
and signify, “Let the soul come.” This stone
has met with the same fate as the gem engraved
with the head of Ptolomæus Philopator:
for here an Egyptian has joined two
random figures, and there the inscription
may be of a Greek hand. The litterati
know what little change it wants to be orthographical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p class="dropcap">I could not presume that so small a
treatise as mine would be thought of
consequence enough to be brought to a
publick trial. As it was written only for a
few <i>connoisseurs</i>, it seemed superfluous to give
it a learned air, by multiplying quotations.
Artists want but hints: their task, according
to an ancient Rhetor, is “to perform,
not to peruse;” consequently every author,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
who writes for them, ought to be brief.
Being besides convinced, that the beauties
of the art are founded rather on a quick
sense, and refined taste, than on profound
meditation, I cannot help thinking that the
principle of Neoptolemus<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>, “to philosophize
only with the few,” ought to be the
chief consideration in every treatise of this
kind.</p>

<p>Several passages of my Essay are susceptible
of explications, and, having been publickly
tried by an anonymous author, should
be explained and defended at the same time,
if my circumstances would permit me to enlarge<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>.
As to his other remarks, the author,
I hope, will guess at my answer,
without my giving one explicitly.—Indeed
they do not require any.</p>

<p>I am not in the least moved by the clamours
concerning those pieces of <i>Corregio</i>,
which, by undoubted accounts, were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
only brought to <i>Sweden</i><a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>, but even hung up
in the stables at <i>Stockholm</i>. Reasoning is of
no use here: arguments of this kind admit
of no other evidence but that of <i>Æmilius
Scaurus</i> against <i>Valerius</i> of <i>Sucro</i>: “He denies;
I affirm: Romans! ’tis yours to
judge.”</p>

<p>And why should there be any thing more
derogatory to the honour of the Swedes, in
my repeating Count <i>Tessin</i>’s relation, than in
his giving it? Perhaps, because the learned
author of the circumstantial life of Queen
<i>Christina</i> omits her indiscreet generosity towards
<i>Bourdon</i>, and that bad treatment
which the pictures of <i>Corregio</i> met with?
or was <i>Härleman</i><a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> himself charged with
indiscretion or malice, on his relating that,
at <i>Lincöping</i>, he found a college, and seven
professors, but not one physician or artificer?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>It was my design to explain myself more
particularly, concerning the negligences
of the Greeks, had I been allowed time.
The Greeks, as their criticism on the partridge
of Protogenes, and his blotting it<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>,
evidently shews, were not ignorant in learned
negligence. But the Zeus of Phidias was
the standard of sublimity, the symbol of the
omnipresent Deity; like Homer’s Eris, he
stood upon the earth, and reached heaven;
he was, in the style of sacred poesy, “<i>What
encompasses him?</i> &amp;c.” And the world has
been candid enough to excuse, nay, even to
justify on such reasons, the disproportions in
the Carton of Raphael, representing the
fishing of Peter<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>. The criticism on the <i>Diomedes</i>,
though solid, is not against me: his
action, abstractedly considered, with his
noble and expressive contour, are standards
of the art; and that was all I advanced<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>The reflections on the Painting and Sculpture
of the Greeks may be reduced to four
heads, viz.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. The perfect Nature of the Greeks;</p>

<p>II. The Characteristicks of their works;</p>

<p>III. The Imitation of these;</p>

<p>IV. Their manner of Thinking upon the Art; and Allegory.</p>

</div>

<p>Probability was all I pretended to, with
regard to the first; which cannot be fully
demonstrated, notwithstanding all the assistance
of history. For, these advantages of
the Greeks were, perhaps, less founded on
their nature, and the influences of the climate,
than on their education.</p>

<p>The happy situation of their country was,
however, the basis of all; and the want of
resemblance, which was observed between
the Athenians and their neighbours beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the mountains, was owing to the difference
of air and nourishment<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>.</p>

<p>The manners and persons of the new-settled
inhabitants, as well as the natives of
every country, have never failed of being
influenced by their different natures. The
ancient Gauls, and their successors the German
Franks, are but one nation: the blind
fury, by which the former were hurried
on in their first attacks, proved as unsuccessful
to them in the times of Cæsar<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>, as it
did to the latter in our days. They possessed
certain other qualities, which are still
in vogue among the modern French; and
the Emperor Julian<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> tells us, that in his
time there were more dancers than citizens
at Paris.</p>

<p>Whereas the Spaniards, managing their
affairs cautiously, and with a certain frigidity,
kept the Romans longer than any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
other people from conquering the country<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>.</p>

<p>And is not this character of the old Iberians
re-assumed by the West-Goths, the
Mauritanians, and many other people, who
over-ran their country?<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>It is easy to be imagined what advantages
the Greeks, having been subject to the same
influences of climate and air, must have
reaped from the happy situation of their
country. The most temperate seasons reigned
through all the year, and the refreshing
sea-gales fanned the voluptuous islands of
the Ionick sea, and the shores of the continent.
Induced by these advantages, the
Peloponnesians built all their towns along
the coast; see Dicearchus, quoted by Cicero<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>.</p>

<p>Under a sky so temperate, nay balanced
between heat and cold, the inhabitants cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
fail of being influenced by both. Fruits
grow ripe and mellow, even such as are
wild improve their natures; animals thrive
well, and breed more abundantly. “Such
a sky, says Hippocrates<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>, produces not only
the most beautiful of men, but harmony
between their inclinations and shape.” Of
which Georgia, that country of beauty,
where a pure and serene sky pours fertility,
is an instance<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>. Among the elements,
beauty owes so much to water alone, that,
if we believe the Indians, it cannot thrive, in
a country that has it not in its purity<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>. And
the Oracle itself attributes to the lymph
of Arethusa a power of forming beauty<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>.</p>

<p>The Greek tongue affords us also some
arguments in behalf of their frame. Nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
moulds the organs of speech according
to the influences of the climate. There are
nations that rather whistle than speak, like
the Troglodytes<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>; others that pronounce
without opening their lips<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>; and the Phasians,
a Greek people, had, as has been
said of the English<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>, a hoarse voice: an unkind
climate forms harsh sounds, and consequently
the organs of speech cannot be
very delicate.</p>

<p>The superiority of the Greek tongue is
incontestible: I do not speak now of its richness,
but only of its harmony. For all the
northern tongues, being over-loaded with
consonants<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>, are too often apt to offend with
an unpleasing austerity; whereas the Greek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
tongue is continually changing the consonant
for the vowel, and two vowels, meeting
with but one consonant, generally grow
into a diphthong<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>. The sweetness of the
tongue admits of no word ending with these
three harsh letters Θ, Φ, Χ, and for the
sake of Euphony, readily changes letters
for their kindred ones. Some seemingly
harsh words cannot be objected here; none
of us being acquainted with the true Greek
or Roman pronunciation. All these advantages
gave to the tongue a flowing softness,
brought variety into the sounds of its words,
and facilitated their inimitable composition.
And from these alone, not to mention the
measure which, even in common conversation,
every syllable enjoyed, a thing to be
despaired of in occidental tongues; from
these alone, I say, we may form the highest
idea of the organs by which that tongue
was pronounced, and may more than conjecture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
that, by the language of the <i>Gods</i>,
Homer meant the Greek, by that of <i>Men</i>,
the Phrygian tongue.</p>

<p>It was chiefly owing to that abundance of
vowels, that the Greek tongue was preferable
to all others, for expressing by the sound
and disposition of its words the forms and
substances of things. The discharge, the
rapidity, the diminution of strength in piercing,
the slowness in gliding, and the stopping
of an arrow, are better expressed by the sound
of these three verses of Homer, Iliad Δ.</p>

<p class="noindent">is of the same kind, and has never been hit
by any imitation: what beauties in one
line!</p>

<p>Plato’s periods were, from their harmony,
compared<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> to a noiseless smooth-running
stream. But we should be mistaken in confining
the tongue to the softer harmonies
only: it became a roaring torrent, boisterous
as the winds by which Ulysses’ sails were
torn, split only in three or four places by
the words, but rent by the sound into a
thousand tatters<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>. This was the “<i>vivida
expressio</i>,” the living sound; supremely beautiful,
when properly and sparingly used!</p>

<p>How quick, how refined must the organs
have been, which were the depositaries of
such a tongue! The Roman itself could
not attain its excellence: nay, a Greek father,
of the second century of the christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
æra<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>, complains of the horrid sound of the
Roman laws.</p>

<p>Nature keeps proportion; consequently
the frame of the Greeks was of a fine clay,
of nerves, and muscles most sensibly elastic,
and promoting the flexibility of the body:
hence that easiness, that pliant facility, accompanied
with mirth and vigour, which
animated all their actions. Imagine bodies
most nicely balanced between leanness and
corpulency: both extremes were ridiculed
by the Greeks, and their poets sneer at the
Philesiases<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>, Philetases<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>, and Agoracrituses<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>.</p>

<p>But though they were beautiful, and by
their law early initiated into pleasure, they
were not effeminate Sybarites. As an instance
of which we shall only repeat what
Pericles pleaded in favour of the Athenian
manners, against those of Sparta, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
were as different from those of the rest of
Greece, as their public oeconomy was:
“The Spartans, says Pericles, employ their
youth to get, by violent exercises, manly
strength: but we, though living indolently,
encounter every danger as well as
they; calmly, not anxiously, mindful of
its approaches, we meet it with voluntary
magnanimity, and without any compulsion
of the law. Not disconcerted by its
impending threats, we meet its most furious
attacks, with no less boldness than
they, whom perpetual practice has prepared
for its strokes. We are fond of
elegance, without loving finery; of genius,
without being emasculate. In short,
to be fit for every great enterprize, is the
characteristic of the Athenians<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>.”</p>

<p>I cannot, nor will I pretend to fix a rule
without allowing exceptions. There was
a Thersites in the army of the Greeks. But
it is worth observing, that the beauty of a
nation was always in proportion to their cultivation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
of the arts. Thebes, wrapt up in
a misty sky, produced a sturdy uncouth
race<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>,<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>according to Hippocrates’s observation
on fenny, watry soils<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>; and its sterility
in producing men of genius, Pindar only
excepted, is an old reproach. Sparta was
as defective in this respect as Thebes, having
only Alcman to boast of; but the reasons
were different: whereas Attica enjoyed
a pure and serene sky, which refined the
senses<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>, and of course shaped their bodies in
proportion to that refinement; and Athens
was the seat of arts. The same remark
may be made with regard to Sicyon, Corinth,
Rhodes, Ephesus, &amp;c. all which
having been schools of the arts, could not
want convenient models. The passage of
Aristophanes, insisted on in the letter<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
take for a joke, as it really is—and thereby
hangs a tale: to have the parts, whereon</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="noindent">moderately complete, were Attick beauties.
Theseus<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>, made prisoner by the Thesprotians,
was delivered from his captivity by
Hercules, but not without some loss of the
parts in question; a loss bequeathed to all
his race. This was the true mark of the
Thesean pedigree; as a natural mark, representing
a spear<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>, signified a Spartan extraction;
and we find the Greek artists imitating
in those places the sparing hand of nature.</p>

<p>But this liberality of nature was confined
to Greece, in a narrower sense. Its colonies
underwent the same fate, which its eloquence
met with when going abroad. “As soon,
says Cicero<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>, as eloquence set out from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the Athenian port, she plumed herself
with the manners of all the islands in
her way, adopted the Asiatick luxury,
and forsaking her sound Attick expression,
lost her health.” The Ionians,
transplanted by Nileus from Greece into
Asia, after the return of the Heraclides,
grew still more voluptuous beneath that
glowing sky. Heaps of vowels brought
wantonness into every word; the neighbouring
islands partook of their climate and
manners, which a single Lesbian coin may
convince us of<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>. No wonder then, if their
bodies degenerated as much from those of
their ancestors, as their manners.</p>

<p>The remoter the colonies the greater the
difference. Those Greeks, who had chosen
their abode in Africa, about <i>Pithicussa</i>, fell
in with the natives in adoring apes; nay,
even gave the names of those animals to
their children<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>The modern Greeks, though composed
of various mingled metals, still betray the
chief mass. Barbarism has destroyed the
very elements of science, and ignorance over-clouds
the whole country; education, courage,
manners are sunk beneath an iron sway, and
even the shadow of liberty is lost. Time, in
its course, dissipates the remains of antiquity:
pillars of Apollo’s temple at Delos<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>, are
now the ornaments of English gardens: the
nature of the country itself is changed. In
days of yore the plants of Crete<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> were famous
over all the world; but now the
streams and rivers, where you would go in
quest of them, are mantled with wild luxuriant
weeds, and trivial vegetables<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>.</p>

<p>Unhappy country! How could it avoid
being changed into a wilderness, when such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
populous tracts of land as Samos, once
mighty enough to balance the Athenian
power at sea, are reduced to hideous desarts<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>!</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these devastations,
the forlorn prospect of the soil, the free passage
of the winds, stopped by the inextricable
windings of entangled shores, and
the want of almost all other commodities;
yet have the modern Greeks preserved many
of the prerogatives of their ancestors. The
inhabitants of several islands, (the Greek race
being chiefly preserved in the islands), near
the Natolian shore, especially the females,
are, by the unanimous account of travellers,
the most beautiful of the human race<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>.</p>

<p>Attica still preserves its air of philanthropy<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>:
all the shepherds and clowns welcomed the
two travellers, Spon and Wheeler; nay, prevented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
them with their salutations<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>: neither
have they lost the Attick salt, or the enterprising
spirit of the former inhabitants<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>.</p>

<p>Objections have been made against their
early exercises, as rather derogating from,
than adding to, the beauteous form of the
Greek youths.</p>

<p>Indeed, the continual efforts of the nerves
and muscles seem rather to give an angular
gladiatorial turn, than the soft Contour
of beauty, to youthful bodies. But this may
partly be answered by the character of the
nation itself: their fancy, their actions, were
easy and natural; their affairs, as Pericles
says, were managed with a certain carelessness,
and some of Plato’s dialogues<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> may
give us an idea of that mirth and chearfulness
which prevailed in all the Gymnastick
exercises of their youth. Hence his desire
of having these places, in his commonwealth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
frequented by old folks, in order
to remind them of the joys of their youth<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>.</p>

<p>Their games commonly began at sun
rise<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>; and Socrates frequented them at that
time. They chose the morning-hours, in order
to avoid being incommoded by the heat:
as soon as their garments were laid down,
the body was anointed with the elegant Attick
oil, partly to defend it from the bleak
morning-air; as it was usual to practice,
even during the severest cold<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>; and partly
to prevent a too copious perspiration,
where it was intended only to carry off
superfluous humours<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>. To this oil they
ascribed also a strengthening quality<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
exercises being over, they went to bathe,
and there submitted to a fresh unction; and
a person leaving the bath in this state “appears,
says Homer, taller, stronger, and
similar to the immortal Gods<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>.”</p>

<p>We may form a very distinct idea of the
different kinds and degrees of wrestling
among the ancients, from a vase once in
the possession of Charl. Patin, and, as he
guesses, the urn of a gladiator<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>.</p>

<p>Had it been a prevailing custom among
the Greeks to walk, either barefooted, like
the heroes in their performances<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>, or with
a single sole, as we commonly believe, their
feet must have been bruised. But there are
many instances of their extreme nicety in
this respect; for, they had names for above
ten different sorts of shoes<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>The coverings of the thighs were thrown
off at the publick exercises, even before the
flourishing of the art<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>; which was a great
advantage to the artists. As for the nourishment
of the wrestlers in remoter times,
I found it more proper to mention milk in
general, than soft cheese.</p>

<p>If I remember right, you think it strange,
and even undemonstrable, that the primitive
church should have dipped their proselytes,
promiscuously: consult the note<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>.</p>

<p>As I am now entering upon the discussion
of my second point, I could wish that
these probabilities of a more perfect nature,
among the Greeks, might be allowed to
have some conclusive weight; and then I
should have but a few words to add.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Charmoleos</i>, a Megarian youth, a single
kiss of whom was valued at two talents<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>,
was, no doubt, beautiful enough to serve
for a model of <i>Apollo</i>: Him, <i>Alcibiades</i>,
<i>Charmides</i>, and <i>Adimanthus</i><a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>, the artists could
see and study to their wish for several hours
every day: and can you imagine those trifling
opportunities proposed to the Parisian artists,
equivalents for the loss of advantages like
these? But granting that, pray, what is
there to be seen more in a swimmer than in
any other person? The extremities of the
body you may see every where. As for that
author<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>, who pretends to find in France
beauties superior to those of <i>Alcibiades</i>, I
cannot help doubting his ability to maintain
what he asserts.</p>

<p>What has been said hitherto might also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
answer the objection drawn from the judgment
of our academies, concerning those parts of the
body which ought to be drawn rather more
angular than we find them in the antiques.
The Greeks, and their artists, were happy
in the enjoyment of figures endowed with
youthful harmony; for, we have no reason
to doubt their exactness in copying nature,
if we only consider the angular smartness
with which they drew the wrist-bones.
<i>Agasias</i>’s celebrated <i>Gladiator</i>, in the <i>Borghese</i>,
has none of the modern angles, nor
the bony prominences authorised by our artists:
all his angular parts are those we meet
with in the other Greek statues. And this
statue, which was perhaps one of those that
were erected, in the very places where the
games were held, to the memory of the
several victors, may be supposed an exact
copy of nature. The artist was bound to
represent any victor in the very attitude, and
instantaneous motion, in which he overcame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
his antagonist, and the <i>Amphictyones</i> were
the judges of his performance<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>.</p>

<p>Many authors having written on this, and
the following point of the treatise, I have
contented myself with giving a few remarks
of my own. Superficial arguments, in matters
of this kind, can neither suit the deeper
views of our times, nor lead to general conclusions.
Nevertheless we do not want authors
whose premature decisions often get
the better of their judgment, and that not
in matters concerning the art alone. Pray,
what decisions of an author may be depended
upon, who, when designing to write on the
arts in general, shews himself so ignorant
of their very elements, as to ascribe to <i>Thucydides</i>,
whose concise and energetick style
was not without difficulties, even for <i>Tully</i><a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>,
the character of simplicity?<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Another of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
that tribe, seems as little acquainted with
<i>Diodorus Siculus</i>, when he describes him as
hunting after elegance<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>. Nor want we
blockheads enough who admire, in the ancient
performances, such trifles as are below
any reasonable man’s attention. “The
rope, says a travelling scribler, which ties
together Dirce and the ox, is to connoisseurs
the most beautiful object of the
whole groupe of the Toro Farnese<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>.”</p>

<p class="noindent">I am no stranger to those merits of the modern
artists which you oppose to the ancients:
but at the same time I know, that
the imitation of these alone has elevated the
others to that pitch of merit; and it would
be easy to prove that, whenever they forsook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the ancients, they fell into the faults
of those, whom alone I intended to blame.</p>

<p>Nature undoubtedly misled Bernini: a
<i>Carita</i> of his, on the monument of Pope
Urban the VIIIth, is said to be corpulent,
and another on that of Alexander the VIIth,
even ugly<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>. Certain it is, that no use could
be made of the Equestrian statue of Lewis
XIV. on which he had bestowed fifteen
years, and the King immense sums. He
was represented as ascending, on horseback,
the mount of honour: but the action both
of the rider and of the horse was exaggerated,
and too violent; which was the cause
of baptizing it a Curtius plunging into the
gulph, and its having been placed only in the
Thuilleries: from which we may infer, that
the most anxious imitation of nature is as little
sufficient for attaining beauty, as the study
of anatomy alone for attaining the justest
proportions: these Lairesse, by his own account,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
took from the skeletons of Bidloo;
but, though a professor in his art, committed
many faults, which the good Roman
school, especially Raphael, cannot be
charged with. However, it is not meant
that there is no heaviness in his Venus; nor
does it clear him from the faults imputed to
him in the Massacre of the Innocents, engraved
by Marc. Antonio, as has been attempted
in a very rare treatise on painting<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>; for there
the female figures labour under an exuberance
of breasts; whereas the murderers look
ghastly with leanness: a contrast not to be
admired: the sun itself has spots.</p>

<p>Let Raphael be imitated in his best manner,
and when in his prime; those works
want no apology: it was to no purpose to
produce Parrhasius and Zeuxis in order to
excuse Him, and the Dutch proportions!
’Tis true, the passage of Pliny<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>, which you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
quote concerning Parrhasius, meets commonly
with the same interpretation, viz.
<i>that, shunning corpulency he fell into leanness</i><a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>.
But supposing Pliny to have understood
what he wrote, we must clear him of
contradicting himself. A little before he
allowed to Parrhasius a superiority in the
contour, or in his own words, <i>in the outlines</i>;
and in the passage before us, <i>Parrhasius,
compared with himself, seems, in <span class="smcap">Point
of the middle parts</span>, to fall short of
himself</i>. The question is, what he means
by middle parts? Perhaps the parts bordering
on the outlines: but is not the designer
obliged to know every possible attitude of
the frame, every change of its contour? If
so, it is ridiculous to give this explication
to our passage: for the middle parts of a
full face are the outlines of its profile, and
so on. Consequently, there is no such thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
as middle parts to be met with by a designer:
the idea of a painter, well-skilled in
the contour of the outlines, but ignorant of
their contents, is an absurd one. Parrhasius
perhaps either wanted skill in the Chiaroscuro,
or Keeping in the disposition of his
limbs, and this seems the only explication,
which the words of Pliny can reasonably
admit of. Unless we choose to make him
another La Fage, who, though a celebrated
designer, never failed spoiling his contours
with his colours. Or, perhaps, to indulge
another conjecture, Parrhasius smoothed the
outlines of his contour, where it bordered
on the grounds, in order to avoid being
rough; a fault committed, as it seems, by
his contemporaries, and by the artists who
flourished in the beginning of the sixteenth
century, who circumscribed their figures, as
it were with a knife; but those smooth contours
wanted the support of keeping, and of
masses gradually rising or sinking, in order
to become round, and to strike the eye: by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
failing in which, his figures got an air of
flatness; and thus Parrhasius fell short of
himself, without being either too corpulent
or too lean.</p>

<p>We cannot conclude, from the Homeric
shape which Zeuxis gave his female
figures, that he raised them, like Rubens,
into flesh-hills. There is some reason to
believe, from the education of the Spartan
ladies, that they had something of a masculine
vigour, though they were the chief
beauties of Greece; and such a one is the
Helena of Theocritus.</p>

<p>All this makes me doubt of finding among
the ancients any companion for Jacob Jordans,
though he is so zealously defended in
your letter. Nor am I afraid of maintaining
what I have said concerning him. Mr.
d’Argenville is indeed a very industrious
collector of criticisms upon the artists; but
as his design is not very extensive, so his decisions
are often too general, to afford us
characteristical ideas of his heroes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>A good eye must be allowed to be a better
judge, in matters of this kind, than all
the ambiguous decisions of authors: and to
fix the character of Jordans, I might content
myself with appealing to his Diogenes,
and the Purification, in the royal cabinet
at Dresden. But, for the reader’s sake, let
me inquire into the meaning of what you
call <i>Truth</i> in painting. For if truth, in the
general sense, can by no means be excluded
from any branch of the arts, we
have, in the decision of Mr. d’Argenville, a
riddle to unfold, which, if it has any meaning
at all, must have the following:</p>

<p>Rubens, enabled by the inexhaustible fertility
of his genius, to pour forth fictions
like Homer himself, displays his riches even
to prodigality: like him he loved the marvellous,
as well in thought and grandeur
of conception, as in composition, and chiar’-oscuro.
His figures are composed in a manner
unknown before him, and his lights,
jointly darting upon one great mass, diffuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
over all his works a bold harmony, and
amazing spirit. Jordans, a genius of a
lower class, cannot, in the ideal part of
painting, by any means be compared with
his great master. He had no wings to soar
above nature; for which reason he humbly
followed, and painted her as he found her:
and if this be <i>truth</i>, he, no doubt, had a
larger share of it than Rubens.</p>

<p>If the modern artists, with regard to
forms and beauty, are not to be directed
by antiquity, there is no authority left to influence
them. Some, in painting Venus,
would give her a Frenchified air<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>; another
would present her with an Aquiline nose,
the Medicean Venus, as they would say,
having such a one<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>: her hands would be
provided with spindles instead of fingers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and she would ogle us with Chinese eyes,
like the beauties of a new Italian school.
Every artist, in short, would, by his performance,
betray his country: but, as Democritus
says<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>, if the artists ought to pray
the gods to let them meet with none but
auspicious images, those of the ancients will
best suit their wishes.</p>

<p>Let us, however, make some exception
in favour of Fiamingo’s children. For,
lustiness and full health being the common
burden of the praises of children, whose infant
forms are not strictly susceptible of that
beauty, which belongs to the steadiness of
riper years; the imitation of his children
has reasonably become a fashion among our
artists. But neither this, nor the indulgence
of the academy at Vienna, can be,
or indeed was meant to be decisive, in favour
of the modern children; it only leads
us to make a distinction. The ancients<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
went beyond nature, even in their children:
the moderns only follow her; and, provided
their infant forms, exuberant as they
are, do not influence their ideas of youthful
and riper bodies, they may be allowed
to be in the right, though, at the same time,
the ancients were not in the wrong.</p>

<p>Our artists are, likewise, at full liberty
to dress the hair of their figures as they
please: but, being so fond of nature, they,
must needs know, that it is nature which
shades, with pendant locks, the forehead and
temples of all those, whose life is not spent
between the comb and the looking-glass:
and finding this manner carefully observed
in most statues of the ancients, they may
take it as a proof of their attachment to
simplicity and truth; a proof of the more
weight, as they did not want people, busier
in adorning their bodies than their minds,
and as nice in adjusting their hair, as the
most elegant of our European courtiers. But
it was commonly looked upon as a mark of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
an ingenuous and noble extraction, to dress
the hair in the manner of the statues<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>.</p>

<p>The imitation of the ancient contour has
indeed never been rejected, not even by those
whose chief want was that of correctness:
but we differ about imitating that “noble
simplicity and sedate grandeur” in their
works. An expression which hath seldom
met with general approbation, and never
pronounced without hazard of being misunderstood.</p>

<p>In the Hercules of Bandinelli, the idea of
it was deemed a fault<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>: an usurpation in
Raphael’s Massacre of the Innocents<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>.</p>

<p>The idea of “nature at rest,” I own,
might, perhaps, produce figures like the
young Spartans of Xenophon; nor would
the bulk of mankind be better pleased with
performances in the taste of my treatise,
(supposing even all its precepts authorised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
by the judges of the art) than with a speech
made before the Areopagites. But it is not
on the bulk of mankind that we ought to
confer the legislative power in the art.
And though works of an extensive composition
ought certainly to have the support
of a vigour and spirit proportioned to their
extent, yet there are limits which must not
be overleapt: use not so much spirit as to
represent the everlasting Father like the cruel
God of war, or an ecstasied saint like a
priestess of Bacchus.</p>

<p>Indeed, in the eyes of one unacquainted
with this characteristick of the sublime, a
Madonna of Trevisani will seem preferable
to that of Raphael in the royal cabinet at
Dresden. I know that even artists were of
opinion, that its being placed so near one of
the former, was not a little disadvantageous
to it. Hence it seemed not superfluous to
enquire into the true grandeur of that inestimable
picture, as it is the only production<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
of this Apollo of painters, that
Germany is possessed of.</p>

<p>No comparison, indeed, is to be made
of its composition with that of the transfiguration;
which, however, I think fully
compensated by its being genuine: whereas
Julio Romano might perhaps claim one half
of the other as his own. The difference of
the hands is visible: but in the Madonna,
the spirit of that epoch, in which Raphael
performed his Athenian school, shines with
so full a lustre, as to make even the authority
of Vasari superfluous.</p>

<p>’Tis no easy matter to convince a critick,
conceited enough to blame the Jesus of the
Madonna, that he is mistaken. Pythagoras,
says an antient philosopher<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>, and Anaxagoras
look at the sun with different eyes:
the former sees a God, the latter a stone.
We want but experience to discover truth
and beauty in the faces of Raphael, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
enquiring into their dignity: beauty
pleases, but serious graces charm<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>. Such
are the beauties of the ancients, which
gave that serious air to Antinous, which
we generally ascribe to his shading locks.
Sudden raptures, or the enticement of a
glance, are often momentary; let an attentive
eye dwell upon those confused beauties
which the transient look conveys, and the
paint will vanish. True charms owe their
durability to reflection, and hidden graces allure
our enquiries: reluctant and unsatisfied
we leave a coy beauty, in continual admiration
of some new-fancied charm: and
such are the beauties of Raphael and the
ancients; not agreeably trifling ones, but
regular and full of real graces<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>. By that
Cleopatra became the beauty of all ensuing
ages: nobody<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> was astonished at her face,
but her air engaged every eye, and subdued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the melted heart. A French Venus at her
toilet is much like Seneca’s wit: which, if
put to the test, disappears<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>.</p>

<p>The comparison of Raphael and some of
the most celebrated Dutch, and new Italian
painters, concerns only the management,
(<i>Trattamento</i>). The endeavours of the former
of these, to hide the laborious industry that
appears in all their works, gives an additional
sanction to my judgment; for, hiding
is labour. The most difficult part in performances
of the arts, is to spread an air
of easiness, the “<span class="smcap">ut sibi quivis</span>” over
them<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>; of which, among the ancients, the
pictures of Nicomachus were entirely destitute<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>.</p>

<p>All this, however, is not meant to derogate
from Vanderwerf’s superior merit: his
works give a lustre even to the cabinets of
kings. He diffused over them an inconceivable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
polish; every trace of his pencil, one
would think, is molten; and, in the colliquation
of his tints, there reigns but
one predominant colour. He might be
said to have enamelled rather than painted.</p>

<p>His works indeed please. But does the
character of painting consist in pleasing alone?
Denner’s bald pates please likewise.
But what, do you imagine, would the wise
ancients think of them? Plutarch, from
the mouth of some Aristides or Zeuxis,
would tell him, that beauty never dwells in
wrinkles<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>.</p>

<p>’Tis said, the Emperor Charles VI. when
he first saw one of Denner’s pictures, was
loud in its praise, and in admiration of his
industry. The painter was immediately desired
to make a fellow to the first, and was
magnificently rewarded: but the Emperor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
comparing each of them with some pieces
of Rembrandt and Vandyke, declared, “that
having now satisfied his curiosity, he would
on no account have any more from this artist.”
An English nobleman was of the
same opinion: for being shewn a picture of
Denner’s, “You are in the wrong, said he,
if you believe that our nation esteems performances,
which owe their merits to industry
rather than to genius.”</p>

<p>I am far from applying these remarks to
Vanderwerf; the difference between him
and Denner is too great: I only joined them
in order to prove, that a picture which
only pleases can no more pretend to universal
approbation than a poem. No; their
charms must be durable; but here we meet
with causes of disgust in the very parts,
where the painter endeavoured to please
us.</p>

<p>Those parts of nature that are beyond
observation, were the chief objects of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
painters: they were particularly cautious of
changing the situation even of the minutest
hair, in order to surprize the most sharp-sighted
eye with all the microcosm of nature.
They may be compared to those disciples
of Anaxagoras, who placed all human
wisdom in the palm of the hand—but
mark, as soon as they attempt to stretch
their art beyond these limits, to draw larger
proportions, or the nudities, the painter appears</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Infelix operis summâ, quia ponere totum nescit.</i></div>
<div class="attr">Hor.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Design is as certainly the painter’s first, second,
and third requisite, as action is that of
the orator.</p>

<p>I readily allow the solidity of your remarks,
concerning the “reliefs” of the ancients.
In my treatise I myself charged
them with a want of sufficient skill in perspective;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and hence the faults in their reliefs.</p>

<p>The fourth point chiefly concerns <i>Allegory</i>.</p>

<p>In painting we commonly call fiction allegory:
for, though imitation arises from
the very principles of painting as well as of
poetry, it constitutes, by itself, neither of
them<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>. A picture, without allegory, is but
a vulgar image, and resembles Davenant’s
Gondibert, an epopée without fiction.</p>

<p>Colouring and design are to painting
what metre and truth, or the fable, are to
poetry; a body without soul. Poetry, says
Aristotle, was first inspired with its soul,
with fiction, by Homer; and with that the
painter must animate his work. Design and
colouring are the fruits of attention and
practice: perspective and composition, in
the strictest sense, are established on fixed
rules; they are of course but mechanical;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and, if I may be allowed the expression, only
mechanical souls are wanting to understand
and to admire them.</p>

<p>Pleasures in general, save only those which
rob the bulk of mankind of their invaluable
treasure, time, become durable, and are free
from tediousness and disgust, in proportion
as they engage our intellectual faculties.
Mere sensual sentiments soon languish; they
do not influence our reason: such is the delight
we take in the common landscape,
flower, and fruit paintings: the artist, in
performing them, thinks but very little;
and the connoisseur, in considering them,
thinks no more.</p>

<p>A mere history-piece differs from a landscape
only in the object: in the former you
draw facts and persons, in the latter, sky,
land, seas, &amp;c. both, of course, being
founded on the same principle, imitation, are
essentially but of one kind.</p>

<p>If it be not a contradiction to stretch the
limits of painting, as far as those of poetry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
and consequently, to allow the painter
the same ability of elevating himself to the
pitch of the poet as the musician enjoys;
it is clear that history, though the sublimest
branch of painting, cannot raise itself to the
heighths of tragick or epick poetry, by imitation
alone.</p>

<p>Homer, as Cicero tells us<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>, has transformed
man into God: which is to say; he
not only exceeded truth, but, to raise his
fiction, preferred even the impossible, if
probable, to the barely possible<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>. In this
Aristotle fixes the very essence of poetry, and
tells us that the pictures of Zeuxis had that
characteristick. The possibility and truth,
which Longinus requires of the painter, as
opposites to absurdity in poetry, are not contradictory
to this rule.</p>

<p>This heighth the history-painter cannot
reach, only by a contour above common nature,
or a noble expression of the passions:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
for these are requisite in a good portrait-painter,
who is able to execute them without
diminishing the likeness of his model.
They are but imitation, only prudently
managed. The heads of Vandyke are
charged with too exact an observation of nature;
an exactness that would be faulty in
a history-piece.</p>

<p>Truth, lovely as it is in itself, charms
more, penetrates deeper, when invested with
fiction: fable, in its strictest sense, is the
delight of childhood; allegory that of riper
years. And the old opinion, that poetry was
of earlier date than prose, as unanimously
attested by the annals of different people,
makes it evident, that even in the most barbarous
times, truth was preferred, when appearing
in this dress.</p>

<p>Our understanding, moreover, labours under
the fault of bestowing its attention chiefly
on things, whose beauties are not to be perceived
at first sight, and of inadvertently
slighting others, because clear as day: images<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
of this kind, like a ship on the waves, leave
but momentary traces in our memory. Hence
the ideas of our childhood are the most permanent,
because every common occurrence
then seems extraordinary. Thus, if nature
herself instructs us, that she is not to be
moved by common things, let art, as the
Orator, ad Herennium, advises us, follow
her dictates.</p>

<p>Every idea increases in strength, if accompanied
by another or more ideas, as in
comparisons; and the more still as they
differ in kind: for ideas, too analogous to
each other, do not strike: as for instance, a
white skin compared to snow. Hence the
power of discovering a similarity, in the most
different things, is what we commonly
call wit; Aristotle, “unexpected ideas”:
and these he requires in an orator<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>. The
more you are surprized by a picture, the
more you are affected; and both those effects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
are to be obtained by allegory, like to
fruit hid beneath leaves and branches, which
when found surprizes the more agreeably, the
less it was thought of. The smallest composition
is susceptible of the sublimest powers
of art: all depends upon the idea.</p>

<p>Necessity first taught the artists to use
allegory. No doubt, they began with the
representation of single objects of one class:
but as they improved, they attempted to express
what was common to many particulars;
<i>i. e.</i> general ideas. All the qualities
of single objects afford such ideas: but to
become general, and at the same time sensible,
they cannot preserve the particular
shape of such or such an object, but must
be submitted to another shape, essential to
that object, but a general one.</p>

<p>The Egyptians were the first, who went
in search of images of that kind. Such
were their hieroglyphicks. All the deities of
antiquity, especially those of Greece, nay,
their very names, were originally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Egyptian<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>. Their personal theology was quite
allegorical; and so is ours. But the symbols
of these inventors, partly preserved by the
Greeks, were often so mysteriously arbitrary,
as to make it altogether impossible to find
out their meaning, even by the help of those
authors that are still extant; and such a discovery
was looked upon as a nefarious profanation<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>.
Thus sacredly mysterious was
the pomegranate<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> in the hand of the Samian
Juno: and to divulge the Eleusinian rites,
was thought worse than the robbery of a
temple<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>.</p>

<p>The relation of the sign to the thing signified,
was in some measure founded on the
known or pretended qualities of the latter.
The Egyptian Horsemarten was of that kind;
an image of the sun, because his species was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
said to have no female, and to live six months
under and six above ground<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>. In like
manner the cat, being supposed to bring
forth a number of kittens equal to that of
the days in a month, became the symbol of
Isis, or the moon<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>.</p>

<p>The Greeks, on the contrary, endowed
with more wit, and undoubtedly with more
sensibility, made use of no signs but such as
had a true relation to the thing signified,
or were most agreeable to the senses: all
their deities they invested with human
forms<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>. Wings, among the Egyptians,
were the symbol of eager and effectual services;
a symbol conformable to their nature,
and continued by the Greeks: and if the
Attick <i>Victoria</i> had none, it was meant to
signify, that she had chosen Athens for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
abode<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>. A goose, among the Egyptians,
was the symbol of a cautious leader; in
consequence of which the prows of their
ships were formed like geese<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>. This the
Greeks preserved also, and the ancient <i>Rostrum</i>
resembled the neck of a goose<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>.</p>

<p>Of all the figures, whose relation to their
intended meaning is somewhat obscure, the
Sphinx perhaps alone was continued by the
Greeks. Placed in the front of a temple,
it was, among the Greeks, almost as instructive,
as it was significant among the
Egyptians<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>. The Greek Sphinx was winged<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>,
its head bare, without that stole which
it wears on some Attick coins<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in general a characteristic of the
Greeks, to mark their productions with a
certain chearfulness: the muses love not
hideous phantoms: and Homer himself,
when by the mouth of some god he cites an
Egyptian allegory, always cautiously begins
with “<span class="smcap">We are told</span>.” Nay, the elder
Pampho<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>, though he exceeds the Egyptian
oddities, by his description of Jupiter wrapt
up in horse-dung, approaches nevertheless
the sublime idea of the English poet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>As full, as perfect, in a hair as heart;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>As full, as perfect, in vile man that mourns,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>As the rapt seraph, that adores and burns.</i></div>
<div class="attr">Pope.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It will be no easy matter to find, among
the old Greek coins, an image like that of a
snake encircling an egg<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>, on a Syrian coin
of the third century. None of their monuments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
are marked with any thing ghastly:
of these they were, if possible, still more
cautious than of ill-omen’d words. The
image of death is not to be seen, perhaps,
but on one gem<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>, and that in the shape commonly
exhibited at their feasts<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>; <i>viz.</i> dancing
to a flute, with intent to make them
enjoy the present pleasures of life, by reminding
them of its shortness. On another
gem<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>, with a Roman inscription, there is a
skeleton, with two butterflies as images of
the soul, one of which is caught by a bird;
a pretended symbol of the metempsychosis:
but the performance is of latter times.</p>

<p>It has been likewise observed, that<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> among
those myriads of altars, sacred even to the
most whimsical deities, there never was one
set apart to death; save only on the solitary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
coasts, which were deemed the borders of
the world<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>.</p>

<p>The Romans, in their best times, thought
like the Greeks; and always, in adopting
the iconology of a foreign nation, traced the
footsteps of these their masters. An elephant,
one of the latter mysterious symbols of the
Egyptians<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> (for there is on the most ancient
monuments neither elephant<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> nor hart, ostrich
nor cock, to be found), was the image
of different things<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>, and perhaps of eternity,
as on some Roman<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> coins, because of
his longevity. But on a coin of the emperor
Antoninus, this animal, with the inscription,
<span class="smcapuc">MUNIFICENTIA</span>, cannot possibly hint at any
other thing but the grand games, the magnificence
of which was augmented by those
animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>But it is no more my design to attempt
an inquiry into the origin of every allegorical
symbol among the Greeks and Romans,
than to write a system of allegory. All I
propose is, to defend what I have advanced
concerning it, and at the same time to direct
the artist to the images of those ancients, in
preference to the iconologies and ill-judged
symbols of some moderns.</p>

<p>We may, from a little specimen, form a
judgment of the turn of mind of those ancients,
and of the possibility of subjecting
abstracted ideas to the senses. The symbols
of many a gem, coin, and monument, enjoy
their fixed and universally received interpretation;
but some of the most memorable,
not yet brought to a proper standard,
deserve a nearer determination.</p>

<p>Perhaps the allegory of the ancients might
be divided, like painting and poetry in general,
into two classes, <i>viz.</i> the <i>sublime</i>,
and the <i>more vulgar</i>. Symbols of the one
might be those by which some mythological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
or philosophical allusion, or even some unknown
or mysterious rite, is expressed.</p>

<p>Such as are more commonly understood,
<i>viz.</i> personified virtues, vices, <i>&amp;c.</i> might be
referred to the other.</p>

<p>The images of the former give to performances
of the art the true epick grandeur:
one single figure is sufficient to give it: the
more it contains, the sublimer it is: the
more it engages our attention, the deeper it
penetrates, and we of course feel it the
more.</p>

<p>The ancients, in order to represent a child
dying in his bloom, painted him carried off
by Aurora<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>: a striking image! taken, perhaps,
from the custom of burying youths at
day-break. The ideas of the bulk of our
artists, in this respect, are too trivial to be
mentioned here.</p>

<p>The animation of the body, one of the
most abstracted ideas, was represented by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the loveliest, most poetical images. An artist,
who should imagine he could express this
idea by the Mosaick creation, would be mistaken;
for his image would be merely historical,
and nothing but the creation of
Adam: a history altogether too sacred for
being either admitted as the allegory of a
mere philosophical idea, or into every place:
neither does it seem poetical enough for the
flights of the art. This idea appears on
coins and gems<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>, as described by the most
ancient poets and philosophers: Prometheus
forming a man of that clay, of which large
petrified heaps were found in Phocis in the
time of Pausanias<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>; and Minerva holding
a butterfly, as an image of the soul, over
his head. The snake encircling a tree behind
Minerva, on the above coin of Antoninus
Pius, is a supposed symbol of his prudence
and sagacity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>It cannot be denied that the meaning of
many an ancient allegory is merely conjectural,
and therefore not to be applied on every
occasion. A child catching a butterfly on an
altar was pretended to signify <i>Amicitia ad
aras</i>, or, “which is not to exceed the borders
of justice<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>.” On another gem, Love,
endeavouring to pull off the branch of an
old tree, where a nightingale is perching, is
said to allegorize love of wisdom<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>. <i>Eros</i>,
<i>Himeros</i>, and <i>Pathos</i>, the symbols of Love,
Appetite, and Desire, are represented, they
say<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>, on a gem, encompassing the sacred
fire on an altar; Love behind the fire,
his head only over-reaching the flames;
Appetite and Desire on both sides of the
altar; Appetite with one hand only in
the fire, with the other holding a garland;
Desire with both his hands in the
flames. A <i>Victoria</i> crowning an anchor, on
a coin of king Seleucus, was formerly regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
as an image of peace and security procured
by victory, till by the help of history
we have been enabled to give it its true interpretation.
Seleucus is said to have been
born with a mark resembling an anchor<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>,
which not only he himself, but all his descendants,
the Seleucidæ, have preserved on
their coins<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>.</p>

<p>There is another Victoria with butterfly’s
wings<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>, fastened on a trophy. This, they
say, is the symbol of a hero, who, like
Epaminondas, died in the very act of conquering.
At Athens such a statue<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>, and an
altar to an unwinged Victoria, was the
symbol of their perpetual success in battle:
ours may admit of the same explication as
Mars in chains at Sparta<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>. Nor was she, as
I presume, provided at random with wings
usually given to Psyche, her own being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
those of an eagle: they perhaps signify the
soul of the deceased: however, all these
conjectures might be tolerable, if a Victoria
fastened on trophies of conquered enemies
could reasonably correspond with their being
vanquished.</p>

<p>Indeed the sublimer allegory of the ancients
has not been transmitted to us, without
the loss of its most valuable treasures: it is
poor, when compared with the second kind,
which is often provided with several symbols
for one idea. Two different ones, signifying
the happiness of the times, are expressed
on coins of the emperor Commodus: the
one a lady<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>, sitting with an apple or ball in
her right, and a dial in her left hand, beneath
a leafy tree: three children are before
her, two in a vase or flower-pot, the usual
symbol of fertility: the other represents four
children, who, as is clear by the things they
bear, are the seasons. Both have the subscription
<span class="smcapuc">FELICITAS TEMPORVM</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>But these, and all the symbols that want
inscriptions, are of a lower rank; and some
of them might as well be taken for signs of
different ideas. Hope<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> and Fertility<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>, for instance,
might be Ceres, Nobility<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>, Minerva.
Patience<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>, on a coin of Aurelian, wants her
true characteristick, as does Erato; and the
Parcæ<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> are only by their garments distinguished
from the Graces. On the contrary,
ideas which are often confounded in morality,
as Justice and Equity, are extremely
well distinguished by the ancients. The
former is represented, as drawn by <i>Gellius</i><a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>,
with a stern look, a diadem, and dressed
hair<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>; the latter with a mild countenance,
and waving ringlets; ears of corn arising
from her balance, as symbols of the advantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
of equity; and sometimes she holds in
her other hand<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> a cornu-copia.</p>

<p>Peace, on a coin of the emperor Titus,
is to be ranked among those of a more energetick
expression. The goddess of Peace
leans on a pillar with her left arm, in the
hand of which she holds the branch of an
olive-tree, whilst the other waves the caduceus
over the thigh of a victim on a little
altar, which hints at the bloodless sacrifices
of that goddess: the victims were slaughtered
out of the temple, and nothing but the
thighs were offered at the altar, which was
not to be stained with blood.</p>

<p>Peace usually appears with the olive-branch
and the caduceus, as on another coin
of this emperor<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>; or on a stool placed on a
heap of arms, as on a coin of Drusus<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>. On
some of Tiberius’s and Vespasian’s coins<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
Peace appears in the act of burning arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>On a coin of the Emperor Philip there is
a noble image; a sleeping Victory: which,
with better reason, may be taken for the
symbol of confidence in conquest, than for
that in the security of the world as the inscription
pretends. Of an analogous idea was
the picture, by which the Athenian General
Timotheus was ridiculed, for the blind luck
with which he obtained his victories: he
was represented asleep, with Fortune catching
Towns in her Net<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>.</p>

<p>The Nile, with his sixteen children, is of
this same class<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>. The child that reaches
the ears of corn, and the fruits, in his
Cornu, is the symbol of the highest fertility;
but those that over-reach them are
signs of miscarrying seasons. Pliny explains
the whole<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>. Egypt is at the height of its
fertility, when the Nile rises sixteen feet:
but if it either falls short of, or exceeds that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
measure, it equally blasts the land with unfruitfulness.
Rossi, in his collection, neglected
the children.</p>

<p>Satyrical pictures belong also to this class:
the Ass of Gabrias, for instance<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>, which
imagines itself worshipped by the people,
as they bow to the statue of Isis on its
back. It is impossible to give a livelier
image of the pride of the Vulgar-Great.</p>

<p>The sublimer allegory might be supplied
by the lower class, had it not met with the
same fate. We are, for instance, not acquainted
with the figure of Eloquence, or
<i>Peitho</i>; or that of the Goddess of Comfort,
<i>Parergon</i>, represented by Praxiteles, as Pausanias
tells us<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>. Oblivion had an altar among
the Romans<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>, and perhaps a figure:
as may also be supposed of Chastity, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
altar is to be found on coins<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>; and of
Fear, to which Theseus offered sacrifices<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>.</p>

<p>However, the remains of ancient allegory
are not yet worn out: there are still many
secret stores: the poets, and other monuments
of antiquity, afford numbers of beautiful
images. Those, who in our time, and
that of our fathers, were busy in improving
allegory, and in facilitating the endeavours
of the artists; those, I say, should reasonably
have had recourse to so rich and pure
a fountain. But there was an epoch to appear,
in which a shocking croud of pedants
should, with downright madness, conspire
in an universal uproar against every the
lead glimpse of good taste. Nature, in their
eyes, was puerile, and ought to be fashioned:
blockheads, both young and old, vied in
painting devices and emblems, for the benefit
of artists, philosophers, and divines; and
woe to him who made a compliment, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
dressing it up in an emblem! Symbols
void of sense were illustrated with inscriptions,
giving an account of what they
meant, and meant not: these are the treasures
which are dug for, even in our times,
and which, being then in high fashion, out-shone
all antiquity had left.</p>

<p>The ancients, for instance, represented
Munificence by a woman holding a Cornucopia
in one hand, and the table of the Roman
Congiarium in the other<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>: an image
which looked too parsimonious for modern
liberality; another therefore was contrived<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>,
with two horns; one of them inverted,
the better to pour out its contents; an eagle,
the meaning of which is too hard for me
to guess at, was set upon her head; others
painted her with a pot in each hand<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>.
Eternity was, by the ancients, drawn either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
sitting on a Globe, or rather Sphere<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>, with a
Hasta in her hand; or standing<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>, with the
Sphere in one hand, and the Hasta in the
other; or with the Sphere in her hand, and
no Hasta; or else covered with a floating
Veil<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>. These are the images of Eternity on
the coins of the Empress Faustina: but there
was not gravity enough in them for the modern
artists. Eternity, so frightful to many,
required a frightful image<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>; a form female
down to the breast, with Globes in each
hand; the rest of the Body a circling star-marked
Snake turning into itself.</p>

<p>Providence very often has a Globe at her
feet, and a Hasta in her left hand<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>. On a
coin of the Emperor Pertinax<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>, she stretches
out both her hands, towards a Globe falling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
from the clouds. A female figure, with
two heads, seemed more expressive to the
moderns<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>.</p>

<p>Constancy, on some of Claudius’s coins<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>,
is either fitting or standing, with a Helmet
on her head, and a Hasta in her left hand;
or without Helmet and Hasta, but always
with a finger pointing to her face, as if
closely debating some point. For distinction
sake the moderns joined a couple of pillars<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>.</p>

<p>It is very probable, that Ripa was often
at a loss with his own figures. Chastity, in
his Iconology, holds in one hand a Whip<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>,
(a strange incitement to virtue) in the other
a Sieve: The first inventor, perhaps, hinted
at Tuccia the vestal; which Ripa not remembring,
indulges the most absurd whims,
not worth repeating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>By thus contrasting ancient and modern
allegory, I mean not to divert our times of
their right of settling new allegories: but
from the different manners of thinking, I
shall draw some rules, for those that are to
tread these paths.</p>

<p>The character of noble simplicity was the
chief aim of the Greeks and Romans: of
which Romeyn de Hooghe has given the
very contrast. His book, in general, may
very fitly be compared to the elm in Virgil’s
hell:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent3"><i>Hanc sedem somnia vulgo</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Vana tenere ferunt, foliisque sub omnibus hærent.</i></div>
<div class="attr">Æn. VI.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The distinctness of the ancient allegory was
owing to the individuation of its images.
Their rule, (if we except only a few of those
above-mentioned), was to avoid every ambiguity;
a rule slightly observed by the moderns:
the Hart, for instance, symbolizing<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
baptism, revenge, remorse, and flattery;
the Cedar, a preacher, worldly vanities, a
scholar, and a woman dying in the pangs of
child-birth.</p>

<p>That simplicity and distinctness were always
accompanied by a certain decency.
A hog signifying, among the Egyptians, a
scrutator of mysteries<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>, together with all the
swine of Cæsar Ripa and some of the moderns,
would have been thought, by the
Greeks, too indecent a symbol of any thing
whatever: save only where that animal
made part of the arms of a place, as it appears
to be on the Eleusinian coins<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>.</p>

<p>The last rule of the ancients was to beware
of signs too near a-kin to the thing
signified. Let the young allegorist observe
these rules, and study them, jointly with
mythology, and the remotest history.</p>

<p>Indeed some modern allegories, (if those
ought to be called modern that are entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
in the taste of antiquity), may perhaps be
compared with the sublimer class of the ancient.</p>

<p>Two brothers of the Barbarigo-family,
immediately succeeding each other<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>, in the
dignity of Doge of Venice, are allegorized
by Castor and Pollux<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>; one of whom, as
the fable tells us, gave the other part of
that immortality which Jupiter had conferred
on him alone. Pollux, in the allegory,
presents his brother, represented by
a skull, with a circling snake, as the symbol
of eternity; on the reverie of a fictitious
coin, beneath the described figures,
there drops a broken branch from a tree,
with the Virgilian inscription,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Primo avulso non deficit alter.</i></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Another idea on one of Lewis XIVth’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
coins, is as worthy of notice; being struck<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
on occasion of the Duke of Lorrain’s quiting
his dominions, after the surrender of
Marsal, for having betrayed both the French
and Austrian courts. The Duke is Proteus
overcome by the arts of Menelaus, and
bound, after having, in vain, tried all his
different forms. At a distance the conquered
citadel is to be seen, and the year
of its surrender marked in the inscription.
There was no occasion for the superfluous
epigraph: <i>Protei Artes delusæ</i>.</p>

<p>Patience, or rather a longing earnest desire<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>,
represented by a female figure, with
folded hands, gazing on a watch, is a very
good image of the lower class. It must indeed
be owned, that the inventors of the
most picturesque allegories have contented
themselves with the remains of antiquity;
none having been authorised to establish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
images of their own fancy, for the general
imitation of the artists. Neither has any
attempt of latter times deferred the honour:
for in the whole Iconology of Ripa, of two
or three that are tolerable ones,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Nantes in gurgite vasto</i>;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">an Ethiopian washing himself, as an allusion
to labour lost<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>, is perhaps the best. There
are indeed images, and useful hints, dispersed
in some books of greater note, (as for instance,
The Temple of Stupidity in the Spectator<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>,)
which ought to be collected, and
made more general. Thus, were the treasures
of science joined to those of art, the
time might come, when a painter would be
able to represent an ode, as well as a tragedy.</p>

<p>I shall myself submit to the publick some
images: for rules instruct, but examples
still more. Friendship, I find every where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
pitifully represented, and its emblems are
not worth mentioning: their flying scribbled
labels shew us the depth of their inventors.</p>

<p>This noblest of human virtues I would
paint in the figures of those two immortal
friends of heroic times, Theseus and Pirithous.
The head of the former is said to
be on gems<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>: he likewise appears with the
club<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> won from Periphetes, a son of Vulcan,
on a gem of Philemon. Theseus consequently
might be drawn with some resemblance.
Friendship, at the brink of
danger, might be taken from the idea of an
old picture at Delphos, as described by Pausanias<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>.
Theseus was painted in the action
of defending himself and his friend against
the Thesprotians, with his own sword in
one hand, and another drawn from the side
of his friend, in the other. The beginning
of their friendship, as described by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Plutarch<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>, might also be an image of that idea.
I am astonished not to have met, among
the emblems of the great men of the Barbarigo-family,
with an image of a good
man and eternal friend. Such was Nicolas
Barbarigo, who contracted with Marco Trivisano
a friendship worthy of immortality;</p>

<p>A little hint of Plutarch’s might furnish
an image of Ambition: he mentions<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> the
sacrifices of Honour, as being performed
bareheaded, whereas all other sacrifices, save
only those of Saturn<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>, were offered with covered
heads. This custom he believes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
have taken its rise from the usual salutation
in society; though it may as well be <i>vice
versa</i>: perhaps it sprung from the Pelasgian
rites<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>, which were performed bareheaded.
Honour is likewise represented by a female
figure, crowned with laurels, a <i>Cornucopia</i>
and <i>Hasta</i> in her hands<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>. Accompanied by
Virtue, a male figure with a helmet, she is
to be found on a coin of Vitellius<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>: and the
heads of both on those of Gordian and
Galien<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>.</p>

<p>Prayers might be personified from an idea
of Homer. Phœnix, the tutor of Achilles,
endeavouring to reconcile him to the Greeks,
makes use of an allegory. “Know Achilles,
says he, that prayers are the daughters
of Zeus<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>; they are bent with kneeling;
their faces sorrowful and wrinkled, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
eyes lifted up to heaven. They follow
Ate; who, with a bold and haughty
mien marches on, and, light of foot as
she is, runs over all the world, to seize
and torment mankind; for ever endeavouring
to escape the Prayers, who incessantly
press upon her footsteps, in order
to heal those whom she hath hurt. Whoever
honours these daughters of Zeus, on
their approach, may obtain much good
from them; but meeting with repulse,
they pray their fire to punish by Ate the
hard-hearted wretch.”</p>

<p>The following well-known old fable might
also furnish a new image. Salmacis, and
the youth beloved by her, were changed to
a fountain, unmanning to such a degree,
that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Quisquis in hos fontes vir venerit, exeat inde</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Semivir: &amp; tactis subito mollescat in undis,</i></div>
<div class="attr">Ovid. Metam. L. IV.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">The fountain was near Halicarnassus in Caria.
Vitruvius<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> thought he had discovered
the truth of that fiction: some inhabitants
of Argos and Trœzene, says he, going thither
with a mind to settle, dispossessed the Carians
and Leleges; who, sheltering themselves
among the mountains, began to harass
the Greeks with their excursions: but
one of the inhabitants having discovered
some particular qualities in that fountain,
erected a building near it, for the convenience
of those who had a mind to make
use of its water. Greeks and Barbarians
mingled there; and these at length, accustomed
to the Greek civility, lost their
savageness, and were insensibly moulded
into another nature. The fable itself is
well known to the artists: but the narrative
of Vitruvius might instruct them how to
draw the allegory of a people taught humanity
and civilised, like the Russians by Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the First. The fable of Orpheus might
serve the same purpose. Expression only
must decide the choice.</p>

<p>Supposing the above general observations
upon allegory insufficient to evince its necessity
in painting, the examples will at least
demonstrate, that painting reaches beyond
the senses.</p>

<p>The two chief performances in allegorical
painting, mentioned in my treatise, viz.
the Luxemburg gallery, and the cupola of
the Imperial Library at Vienna, may shew
how poetical, how happy an use their authors
made of allegory.</p>

<p>Rubens proposing to paint Henry IV.
as a humane victor, with lenity and goodness
prevailing, even in the punishment of
unnatural rebels, and treacherous banditti,
represents him as Jupiter ordering the gods
to overthrow and punish the vices: Apollo
and Minerva let fly their darts upon them,
and the vices, hideous monsters, in a tumultuous
uproar tumble over each other:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Mars, entering in a fury, threatens total
destruction; but Venus, image of celestial
love, gently lays hold of his arm:—you
fancy you hear her blandishing petition to
the <i>mailed</i> god: “rage not with cruel revenge
against the vices—they are punished.”</p>

<p>The whole performance of Daniel Gran<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
is an allegory, relative to the Imperial Library,
and all its figures are as the branches
of one single tree. ’Tis a painted Epopee,
not beginning from the eggs of Leda; but,
as Homer chiefly rehearses the anger of
Achilles, this immortalizes only the Emperor’s
care of the sciences. The preparations
for the building of the library are represented
in the following manner:</p>

<p>Imperial majesty appears as a lady fitting,
her head sumptuously dressed, and on her
breast a golden heart, as a symbol of the
Emperor’s generosity. With her sceptre the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
gives the summons to the builders; at her
feet sits a genius with an angle, palette, and
chissel; another hovers over her with the
figures of the Graces, as symbols of that
good taste which prevailed in the whole.
Next to the chief figure sits general Liberality,
with a purse in her hand; below
her a genius, with the table of the Roman
Congiarius, and behind her the Austrian
Liberality, her mantle embroidered with
larks. Several Genii gather the treasures
that flow from her Cornucopia, in order to
distribute them among the votaries of the
arts and sciences, chiefly those, whose good
offices to the library had entitled them to
regard. The execution of the Imperial orders
personified, directs her face to the commanding
figure, and three children present
the model of the house. Next her an old
man, the image of Experience, measures
on a table the plan of the building, a genius
standing beneath him with a plummet,
as ready to begin. Next the old man sits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Invention, with a statue of Isis in her right,
and a book in her left hand, signifying, that
Nature and Science are the fathers of Invention,
the puzzling schemes of which are represented
by a Sphinx lying before her.</p>

<p>This performance was compared to the
great platfond of Le Moine at Versailles,
with an eye to the newest productions of
France and Germany alone: for the great
gallery of the same palace, painted by
Charles le Brun, is, without doubt, the
sublimest performance of poetick painting,
since the time of Rubens; and being possessed
of this, as well as of the gallery of
Luxemburg, France may boast of the two
most learned allegorical performances.</p>

<p>The gallery of Le Brun contains the history
of Louis XIV. from the Pyrenæan
peace, to that of Nimeguen, in nine large,
and eighteen smaller pieces: that in which
the King determines war against Holland,
contains, in itself alone, an ingenious and
sublime application of almost the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
mythology<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>: its beauties are too exuberant
for this treatise; let the artist’s ideas be
judged only by two of the smaller compositions.
He represents the famous passage
over the Rhine: his hero sits in a chariot,
a thunderbolt in his hand, and Hercules,
the image of heroism, drives him through
the midst of tempestuous waves. The figure
representing Spain is borne down by the current:
the river god, aghast, lets fall his
oar: the victories, approaching on rapid
wings, present shields, marked with the
names of the towns conquered after the
passage. Europa astonished beholds the
scene.</p>

<p>Another represents the conclusion of the
peace. Holland, though with-held by the
Imperial Eagle, snatching her robe, runs to
meet peace, descending from heaven, surrounded
by the Genii of gaiety and pleasure,
scattering flowers all around her. Vanity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
crowned with peacocks feathers; endeavours
to with-hold Spain and Germany from following
their associate: but perceiving the
cavern where arms are forged for France
and Holland, and hearing same threatening
in the skies, they likewise follow her example.
Is not the former of these two performances
comparable, in sublimity, to the
Neptune of Homer, and the strides of his
immortal horses?</p>

<p>But let examples be never so striking,
allegory will still have adversaries: they
rose in times of old, against that of Homer
himself. There are people of too delicate
a conscience, to bear truth and fiction in
one piece: they are scandalized at a poor
river-god in some sacred story. Poussin
met with their reproaches, for personifying
the Nile in his Moses<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>. A still stronger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
party has declared against the obscurity of
allegory; for which they censured, and still
continue to censure, Le Brun. But who is
there so little experienced as not to know,
that perspicuity and obscurity depend often
upon time and circumstances? When Phidias
first added a tortoise<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> to his Venus, ’tis
likely that few were acquainted with his
design in it, and bold was the artist who
first dared to fetter her: time, however,
made the meaning as clear as the figures
themselves. Allegory, as Plato says<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> of
poetry in general, has something enigmatick
in itself, and is not calculated for the bulk
of mankind. And should the painter, from
the fear of being obscure, adapt his performance
to the capacity of those, who look
upon a picture as upon a tumultuous mob,
he might as well check every new and extraordinary
idea. The design of the famous
Fred. Barocci, in his Martyrdom of St. Vitalis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
by drawing a little girl alluring a
magpye with a cherry, must have been very
mysterious to many; the cherry<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> alluding
to the season, in which that saint suffered.</p>

<p>The painting of the greater machines,
and of the larger parts of publick buildings,
palaces, &amp;c. ought to be allegorical. Grandeur
is relative to grandeur; and heroick
actions are not to be sung in elegiack strains.
But is every fiction allegorical in every place?
The Venetian Doge might as well pretend
to enjoy his superiority in <i>Terra firma</i>. I
am mistaken if the Farnesian gallery is to
be ranked among the allegorical performances.
Nevertheless Annibal, perhaps not
having it in his power to choose his subject,
may have been too roughly used in my treatise:
it is known that the Duke of Orleans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
desired Coypel to paint in his gallery the
history of Æneas<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>.</p>

<p>The Neptune of Rubens<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>, in the gallery
at Dresden, painted on purpose to adorn the
magnificent entry of the Infant Ferdinand
of Spain into Antwerp, as governor of the
Netherlands, was there, on a triumphal
arch, allegorical<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>. The god of the ocean
frowning his waves into peace, was a poetick
image of the Princes escaping the
storm, and arriving safe at Genoa. But
now he is nothing more than the Neptune
of Virgil.</p>

<p>Vasari, when pretending to find allegory
in the Athenian school of Raphael<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>, <i>viz.</i>
a companion of philosophy and astronomy
with theology, seems to have required, and,
by the common opinion of his time, to
have been authorised to require something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
grand and above the vulgar, in the decorations
of a grand apartment: though indeed
there be nothing but what is obvious at first
look, and that is, a representation of the
Athenian academy<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>.</p>

<p>But in ancient times, there was no story
in a temple, that was not, at the same time,
allegorical; allegory being closely interwoven
with mythology: the gods of Homer,
says an ancient, are the most lively images
of the different powers of the universe; shadows
of elevated ideas: and the gallantries of
Jupiter and Juno, in the platfond of a temple
of that goddess at Samos, were looked
on as such; air being represented by Jupiter,
and earth by Juno<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>.</p>

<p>Here I think it incumbent upon me to
clear up what I have said concerning the
contradictions in the character of the Athenians,
as represented by Parrhasius. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
you think an easy matter; the painter having
done it either in the historical way, or
in several pictures: which latter is absurd.
Has not there been even a statue of that
people, done by Leochares, as well as a
temple<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>? The composition of the picture
in question, has still eluded all probable conjectures<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>;
and the help of allegory having
been called in, has produced nothing but
Tesoro’s<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> ghastly phantoms. This fatal
picture of Parrhasius, I am afraid, will of
itself be a perpetual instance of the superior
skill of the ancients in allegory.</p>

<p>What has been said already of allegory,
in general, contains likewise what remarks
may be made upon its being applied to decorations;
nevertheless as you insist upon
that point particularly, I shall lightly mention
it too.</p>

<p>There are two chief laws in decoration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
viz. to adorn suitably to the nature of things
and places, and with truth; and not to follow
an arbitrary fancy.</p>

<p>The first, as it concerns the artists in general,
and dictates to them the adjusting of
things in such a manner, as to make them
relative to each other, claims especially a
strict propriety in decorations:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">——<i>Non ut placidis coeant immitia</i>—</div>
<div class="attr">Hor.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The sacred shall not be mixed with the
profane, nor the terrible with the sublime:
this was the reason for rejecting the sheeps-heads<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>,
in the Doric Metopes, at the chapel
of the palace of Luxemburg at Paris.</p>

<p>The second law excludes licentiousness;
nay circumscribes the architect and decorator
within much narrower limits than the
painter; who sometimes must, in spite of
reason, subject his own fancy, and Greece, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
fashion, even in history-pieces: but publick
buildings, and such works as are made
for futurity, claim decorations that will outlast
the whims of fashion; like those that,
by their dignity and superior excellence, bore
down the attacks of many a century: otherwise
they fade away, grow insipid and out
of fashion, perhaps before the finishing of
the very work to which they are added.</p>

<p>The former law directs the artist to allegory:
the latter to the imitation of antiquity;
and this concerns chiefly the smaller
decorations.</p>

<p>Such I call those that make not up of
themselves a whole, or those that are additional
to the larger ones. The ancients never
applied shells, when not required by the
fable; as in the case of Venus and the Tritons;
or by the place, as in the temples of
Neptune: and lamps decked with shells<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
are supposed to have made part of the implements
of those temples. For the same reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
they may give lustre; and be very significant,
in proper places; as in the festoons
of the Stadthouse at Amsterdam<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>.</p>

<p>Sheep and ox-heads stripped of their skin,
so far from justifying a promiscuous use of
shells, as the author seems inclined to think,
are plain arguments to the contrary: for they
not only were relative to the ancient sacrifices,
but were thought to be endowed with
a power of averting lightning<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>; and Numa
pretended to have been secretly instructed
about them by Jupiter<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>. Nor can the Corinthian
capital serve for an instance of a
seemingly absurd ornament, authorised and
rendered fashionable by time alone: for it
seems of an origin more natural and reasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
than Vitruvius makes it; which is,
however, an enquiry more adapted to a
treatise on architecture. Pocock believed
that the Corinthian order had not much
reputation in the time of Pericles, who
built a temple to Minerva: but he should
have been reminded, that the Doric order
belonged to the temples of that goddess, as
Vitruvius informs us<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>.</p>

<p>These decorations ought to be treated like
architecture in general, which owes its grandeur
to simplicity, to a system of few parts,
which being not complex themselves, branch
out into grace and splendour. Remember
here the channelled pillars of the temple of
Jupiter, at Agrigentum, (Girgenti now) which
were large enough to contain, in one single
gutter, a man at full length<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>. In the same
manner these decorations must not only be
few, but those must likewise consist of few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
parts, which are to appear with an air of
grandeur and ease.</p>

<p>The first law (to return to allegory)
might be lengthened out into many a subaltern
rule: but the nature of things and
circumstances is, and ever must be, the artist’s
first aim; as for examples, refutation
promises rather more instruction than authority.</p>

<p>Arion riding on his dolphin, as unmeaningly
represented upon a Sopra-porta, in a
new treatise on architecture<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>, though a significant
image in the apartments of a French
Dauphin, would be a very poor one in any
place where Philanthropy, or the protection
of artists like him, could not immediately
be hinted at. On the contrary, he would
even to this day, though without his lyre,
be an ornament to any publick building at
Tarentum, because the ancient Tarentines,
stamped on their coins the image of Taras,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
one of the sons of Neptune, riding on a
dolphin, on a supposition of his being their
first founder.</p>

<p>The allegorical decorations of a building,
raised by the contributions of a whole
nation, I mean the Duke of Marlborough’s
palace at Blenheim, are absurd: enormous
lions of massy stone, above two portals,
tearing to pieces a little cock<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>. The hint
sprung from a poor pun.</p>

<p>Nor can it be denied that antiquity furnishes
some ideas seemingly analogous to
this: as for instance, the lioness on the
tomb of Leæna, the mistress of Aristogiton,
raised in honour of her constancy amidst the
torments applied by the tyrant, in order to
extort from her a confession of the conspirators
against him. But from this, I am
afraid, nothing can arise in behalf of the
above pitiful decoration: that mistress of
the martyr of liberty having been a notorious
woman, and whose name could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
not decently stand a publick trial. Of the
same nature are the lizards and frogs on a
temple<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>, alluding to the names of the two
architects, Saurus and Batrachus<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>: the above-mentioned
lioness having no tongue,
made the allegory still more expressive. The
lioness on the tomb of the famous Lais<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>,
holding with her fore-paws a ram, as a
symbol of her manners<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>, was perhaps an
imitation of the former. The lion was, in
general, set upon the tombs of the brave.</p>

<p>It is not indeed to be pretended that every
ornament and image of the ancient vases,
tools, &amp;c. should be allegorical; and to explain
many of them, in that way, would be
equally difficult and conjectural. I am not
bold enough to maintain, that an earthen
lamp<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>, in the shape of an ox’s-head, means a
perpetual remembrance of useful labours, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
account of the perpetuity of the fire; nor to
decypher here a mysterious sacrifice to Pluto
and Proserpine<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>. But the image of a Trojan
Prince, carried off by Jupiter, to be his
favourite, was of great and honourable signification
in the mantle of a Trojan. Birds
pecking grapes seem as suitable to an urn,
as the young Bacchus brought by Mercury
to be nursed by Leucothea, on a large marble
vase of the Athenian Salpion<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>. The
grapes may be a symbol of the pleasures the
deceased enjoy in Elysium: the pleasures
of hereafter being commonly supposed to be
such; as the deceased chiefly delighted in
when alive. A bird, I need not say, was
the image of the soul. A Sphinx, on a
cup sacred to Bacchus, is supposed to be an
allusion to the adventures of Oedipus at
Thebes, Bacchus’s birth place<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>; as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Lizard on a cup of Mentor, may hint
at the possessor, whose name perhaps was
Saurus.</p>

<p>There is some reason to search for allegory,
in most of the ancient performances,
when we consider, that they even built allegorically.
Such an allusive building was
a gallery at Olympia<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>, sacred to the seven
liberal arts, and re-echoing seven times a
poem read aloud there. A temple of Mercury,
supported, instead of pillars, by
Herms, or, as we now spell, Terms, on
a coin of Aurelian<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>, is of the same kind:
there is on its front a dog, a cock, and a
tongue; figures that want no explication.</p>

<p>Yet the temple of Virtue and Honour,
built by Marcellus, was still more learnedly
executed: having consecrated his Sicilian
spoils to that purpose, he was disappointed
by the priests, whom he first consulted on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
that design; who told him, that no single
temple could admit of two divinities. Marcellus
therefore ordered two temples to be
built, adjoining to each other, in such a
manner that whoever would be admitted to
that of Honour must pass through that of
Virtue<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>; thus publickly indicating, that virtue
alone leads to true honour: this temple
was near the Porta Capena<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>. And here
I cannot help remembering those hollow
statues of ugly satyrs<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>, which, when opened,
were found replete with little figures of the
graces, to teach, that no judgment is to be
formed from outward appearances, and that
a fair mind makes amends for a homely
body.</p>

<p>Perhaps, Sir, some of your objections may
have been omitted: if so, it was against my
will——and at this instant, I remember one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
concerning the Greek art of changing blue
eyes to black ones. Dioscorides is the only
writer that mentions it<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>. Attempts of this
kind have been made in our days: a certain
Silesian countess was the favourite beauty
of the age, and universally acknowledged
to be perfect, had it not been for her blue
eyes, which some of her admirers wished
were black. The lady, informed of the
wishes of her adorers, by repeated endeavours
overcame nature; her eyes became
black,—and she blind.</p>

<p>I am not satisfied with myself, nor perhaps
have given you satisfaction: but the
art is inexhaustible, and all cannot be written.
I only wanted to amuse myself agreeably
at my leisure hours; and the conversation

<p class="dropcap">You call yourself a <i>Connoisseur</i>, and the
first thing you gaze at, in considering
works of art, is the workmanship, the delicacy
of the pencilling, or the polish given
by the chissel.——It was the idea however,
its grandeur or meanness, its dignity,
fitness, or unfitness, that ought first
to have been examined: for industry and
talents are independent of each other. A
piece of painting or sculpture cannot, merely
on account of its having been laboured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
claim more merit than a book of the same
sort. To work curiously, and with unnecessary
refinements, is as little the mark of
a great artist, as to write learnedly is that
of a great author. An image anxiously
finished, in every minute trifle, may be fitly
compared to a treatise crammed with quotations
of books, that perhaps were never
read. Remember this, and you will not
be amazed at the laurel leaves of <i>Bernini</i>’s
Apollo and Daphne, nor at the net held
by <i>Adams</i>’s statue of water at Potzdam: you
will only be convinced that workmanship is
not the standard which distinguishes the antique
from the modern.</p>

<p>Be attentive to discover whether an artist
had ideas of his own, or only copied those
of others; whether he knew the chief aim
of all art, Beauty, or blundered through the
dirt of vulgar forms; whether he performed
like a man, or played only like a child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>Books may be written, and works of art
executed, at a very small expence of ideas.
A painter may mechanically paint a Madonna,
and please; and a professor, in the
same manner, may write Metaphysics to the
admiration of a thousand students. But
would you know whether an artist deserves
his name, let him invent, let him do the same
thing repeatedly: for as one feature, may
modify a mien, so, by changing the attitude
of one limb, the artist may give a new
hint towards a characteristic distinction of two
figures, in other respects exactly the same,
and prove himself a man. Plato, in <i>Raphael</i>’s
Athenian school, but slightly moves
his finger: yet he means enough, and infinitely
more than all <i>Zucchari</i>’s meteors.
For as it requires more ability to say much
in a few words, than to do the contrary; and
as good sense delights rather in things than
shews, it follows, that one single figure may
be the theatre of all an artist’s skill: though,
by all that is stale and trivial! the bulk of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
painters would think it as tyrannical to be
sometimes confined to two or three figures,
in great only, as the ephemeral writers of
this age would grin at the proposal of beginning
the world with their own private
stock, all public hobby-horses laid aside:
for fine cloaths make the beau. ’Tis hence
that most young artists,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Enfranchis’d from their tutor’s care</i>,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">choose rather to make their entrance with
some perplexed composition, than with one
figure strongly fancied and masterly executed.
But let him, who, content to please
the few, wants not to earn either bread or
applause from a gaping mob, let him remember
that the management of a “<i>little</i>”
more or less really distinguishes artist from
artist; that the truly sensible produces a
multiplicity, as well as quickness and delicacy
of feelings, whilst the dashing quack tickles
only feeble senses and callous organs; that
he may consequently be great in single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
figures, in, the smallest compositions, and
new and various in repeating things the most
trite. Here I speak out of the mouth of
the ancients: this, their works teach: and
both our writers and painters would come
nearer them, did not the one busy themselves
with their words only, the other with
their proportions.</p>

<p>In the face of Apollo pride exerts itself
chiefly in the chin and nether lip; anger
in the nostrils; and contempt in the opening
mouth; the graces inhabit the rest of
his divine, head, and unruffled beauty, like
the sun, streams athwart the passions. In
Laocoon you see bodily pains, and indignation
at undeserved sufferings, twist the nose,
and paternal sympathy dim the eye-balls.
Strokes like these are, as in Homer, a whole
idea in one word; he only finds them who
is able to understand them. Take it for
certain, that the ancients aimed at expressing
much in little,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Their ore was rich, and seven times purg’d of lead</i>:</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">whereas most moderns, like tradesmen in
distress, hang out all their wares at once.
Homer, by raising all the gods from their
seats, on Apollo’s appearing amongst them<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>,
gives a sublimer idea than all the learning of
Callimachus could furnish. If ever a prejudice
may be of use, ’tis here; hope largely
from the ancient works in approaching them,
nor fear disappointments; but examine, peruse,
with cool sedateness and silenced passions,
lest your disturbed brain find Xenophon
flat and Niobe insipid.</p>

<p>To original ideas, we oppose copied, not
imitated ones. Copying we call the slavish
crawling of the hand and eyes, after a certain
model: whereas reasonable imitation
just takes the hint, in order to work by itself.
<i>Domenichino</i>, the painter of Tenderness,
imitated the heads of the pretended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
Alexander at Florence, and of the Niobe at
Rome<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>; but altered them like a master.
On gems and coins you may find many a
figure of <i>Poussin</i>’s: his Salomon is the Macedonian
Jupiter: but whatever his imitation
produced, differs from the first idea, as
the blossoms of a transplanted tree differ
from those that sprung in its native soil.</p>

<p>Another method of copying is, to compile
a Madonna from <i>Maratta</i>; a S. Joseph
from <i>Barocci</i>; other figures from other masters,
and lump them together in order to
make a whole. Many such altar-pieces
you may find, even at Rome; and such a
painter was the late celebrated <i>Masucci</i> of
that city.——Copying I call, moreover, the
following a certain form, without the least
consciousness of one’s being a blockhead.
Such was he who, by the command of
a certain Prince, painted the nuptials of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Psyche, or, if you will, the Queen of Sheba:—’twas
a pity there was no other Psyche to be
found, but that dangerous one of <i>Raphael</i>.
Most of the late great statues of the saints,
in St. Peter’s at Rome, are of the same stuff—the
block at 500 Roman crowns from
the quarry.</p>

<p>The second characteristic of works of art
is Beauty. The highest object of meditation
for man is man, and for the artist
there is none above his own frame. ’Tis by
moving your senses that he reaches your
soul: and hence the analysis of the bodily
system has no less difficulties for him, than
that of the human mind for the philosopher.
I do not mean the anatomy of the
muscles, vessels, bones, and their different
forms and situations; nor the relative measure
of the whole to its parts, and <i>vice
versa</i>: for the knife, exercise, and patience,
may teach you all these. I mean the analysis
of an attribute, essential to man, but
fluctuating with his frame, allowed by all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
misconstrued by many, known by few:—the
analysis of beauty, which no definition
can explain, to him whom heaven hath denied
a soul for it. Beauty consists in the
harmony of the various parts of an individual.
This is the philosopher’s stone,
which all artists must search for, though a
few only find it: ’tis nonsense to him,
who could not have formed the idea out
of himself. The line which beauty describes
is elliptical, both uniform and various: ’tis not
to be described by a circle, and from every
point changes its direction. All this is easily
said; but to apply it—<i>there is the rub</i>.
’Tis not in the power of Algebra to determine
which line, more or less elliptic, forms the
divers parts of the system into beauty—but
the ancients knew it; I attest their works,
from the gods down to their vases. The human
form allows of no circle, nor has any
antique vase its profile semicircular.</p>

<p>After this, should any one desire me to
assist him more sensibly in his inquiries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
concerning beauty, by setting down some
rules (a hard task), I would take them from
the antique models, and in want of these,
from the most beautiful people I could meet
with at the place where I lived. But to instruct,
I would do it in the negative way;
of which I shall give some instances, confining
myself however to the face.</p>

<p>The form of real beauty has no abrupt
or broken parts. The ancients made this
principle the basis of their youthful profile;
which is neither linear nor whimsical,
though seldom to be met with in nature:
the growth, at least, of climates more indulgent
than ours. It consists in the soft
coalescence of the brow with the nose.
This uniting line so indispensably accompanies
beauty, that a person wanting it may
appear handsome full-faced; but mean, nay
even ugly, when taken in profile. <i>Bernini</i>,
that destroyer of art, despised this line,
when legislator of taste, as not finding it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
in common nature, his only model; and
therein was followed by all his school.
From this same principle it necessarily follows,
that neither chin nor cheeks, deep-marked
with dimples, can be consistent with
true beauty. Hence the face of the Medicean
Venus is to be degraded from the first
rank. Her face, I dare say, was taken
from some celebrated fair one, contemporary
with the artist. Two other Venuses,
in the garden behind the Farnese, are manifestly
portraits.</p>

<p>The form of real beauty has neither the
projected parts obtuse, nor the vaulted ones
sharp. The eye-bone is magnificently raised,
the chin thoroughly vaulted. Thus
the best ancients drew: though, when taste
declined amongst them, and the arts were
trampled on in modern times, these parts
changed too: then the eye-bone became
roundish and obtusely dull, and the chin
mincingly pretty. Hence we may safely
affirm, that what they call Antinous, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Belvedere, whose eye-bone is rather obtuse,
cannot be a work of the highest antiquity,
any more than the Venus.</p>

<p>As these remarks are general, they likewise
concern the features of the face, the
form only. There is another charm, that
gives expression and life to forms, which
we call Grace; and we shall give some loose
reflexions on it separately, leaving it to
others to give us systems.</p>

<p>The figure of a man is as susceptible of
beauty as that of a youth: but as a various
one, not the various alone, is the
Gordian knot, it follows, that a youthful
figure, drawn at large, and in the highest
possible degree of beauty, is, of all problems
that can be proposed to the designer,
the most difficult. Every one may convince
himself of this: take the most beautiful
face in modern painting, and it will go
hard, but you shall know a still more
beautiful one in nature.——I speak thus, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
having considered the treasures of Rome
and Florence.</p>

<p>If ever an artist was endowed with beauty,
and deep innate feelings for it; if ever
one was versed in the taste and spirit of the
ancients, ’twas certainly <i>Raphael</i>: yet are
his beauties inferior to the most beautiful
nature. I know persons more beautiful than
his unequalled Madonna, in the <i>Palazzo
Petti</i> at Florence, or the Alcibiades in his
academy. The Madonna in the Christmas-night
of <i>Corregio</i>, (a piece justly celebrated
for its chiar’-oscuro) is no sublime idea;
still less so is that of <i>Maratta</i> at Dresden:
<i>Titian</i>’s celebrated Venus<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> in the Tribuna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
at Florence is common nature. The little
heads of <i>Albano</i> have an air of beauty; but
it is a different thing to express beauty in
little, and in great. To have the theory of
navigation, and to guide a ship through the
ocean, are two things. <i>Poussin</i>, who had
studied antiquity more than his predecessors,
knew perfectly well what his shoulders
could bear, and never ventured into the
great.</p>

<p>The Greeks alone seem to have thrown
forth beauty, as a potter makes his pot.
The heads on all the coins of their Free-states
have forms above nature, which they
owe to the line that forms their profile.
Would it not be easy to hit that line? Yet
have all the numismatic compilers deviated
from it. Might not <i>Raphael</i>, who complained
of the scarcity of beauty, might not
he have recurred to the coins of Syracuse, as
the best statues, Laocoon alone excepted,
were not yet discovered?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>Farther than those coins no mortal idea <i>can</i>
go. I wish my reader an opportunity of
seeing the beautiful head of a genius in the
Villa Borghese, and those images of unparalleled
beauty, Niobe and her daughters.
On the western side of the Alps he must be
contented with gems and pastes. Two of
the most beautiful youthful heads are a Minerva
of Aspasius, now at Vienna, and a
young Hercules in the Museum of the late
Baron Stosch, at Florence.</p>

<p>But let no man, who has not formed his
taste upon antiquity, take it into his head
to act the connoisseur of beauty: his ideas
must be a parcel of whims. Of modern
beauties I know none that could vie with
the Greek female dancer of Mr. <i>Mengs</i>,
big as life, painted in <i>Crayons</i> on wood, for
the Marquis Croimare at Paris, or with his
Apollo amidst the muses, in the Villa Albano,
to whom that of <i>Guido</i> in the Aurora,
compared, is but a mortal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>All the modern copies of ancient gems
give us another proof of the decisive authority
of beauty in criticisms on works of art.
<i>Natter</i> has dared to copy that head of Minerva
mentioned above, in the same size and
smaller, but fell short. The nose is a hair
too big, the chin too flat, and the mouth
mean. And this is the case of modern
imitators in general. What can we hope
then of self-fancied beauties? Conclude not,
however, from this, against the possibility
of a perfect imitation of antique heads:
’tis enough to say, that it has not yet existed:
’twas probably the fault of the imitators
themselves. <i>Natter</i>’s treatise on ancient
gems is rather shallow; and what he
wrought and wrote, even on that single
branch of engraving, for which he was
chiefly celebrated, has neither the strength
nor the ease of genius.</p>

<p>To this consciousness of inferiority we owe
the scarcity of modern supposititious gems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
and coins. Any man of taste may, upon
comparison, distinguish even the best modern
coin from the antique original.—I speak
of the best antiques: for as to the lower
Imperial coins, where the cheat was easier,
the artists have been liberal enough. <i>Padoano</i>’s
stamps, for copying antique coins,
are in the Barberini Collection at Rome, and
those of one <i>Michel</i>, a Frenchman, and false
coiner in taste, at Florence, in that of the
late Baron Stosch.</p>

<p>The third characteristic of works of art is
Execution; or, the sketch being made, the
method of finishing. And even here we
commend good sense above industry. As
in judging of styles, we distinguish the
good writer by the clearness, fluency, and
nervousness of his diction; so in works of
art, we discover the master by the manly
strength, freedom, and steadiness of his
hand. The august contour, and easiness
of mien, in the figures of Christ, St. Peter,
and the other apostles, on the right side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
the Transfiguration, speak the classic hand
of <i>Raphael</i>, as strongly as the smooth, anxious
nicety of some of <i>Julio Romano</i>’s figures,
on the left, the more wavering one of the
disciple.</p>

<p>Never admire either the marble’s radiant
polish, or the picture’s glossy surface. For
that the journeyman sweated; for this the
painter vegetated only. <i>Bernini</i>’s Apollo
is as polished as HE in the Belvedere; and
there is much more labour hid in one of
<i>Trevisani</i>’s Madonnas, than in that of <i>Corregio</i>.
Whenever trusty arms and laborious
industry prevail, we defy all the ancients.
We are not their inferiors even in managing
porphyry, though a mob of scriblers, with
<i>Clarencas</i> in their rear-guard, deny it.</p>

<p>Nor (whatever <i>Maffei</i> thinks<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>,) did the
ancients know a peculiar method of giving
a nicer polish to the figures of their concave
gems (<i>Intagli</i>.) Our artists polish as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
nicely: but statues and gems may be detestable,
for all their polish, as a face may be
ugly, with the softest skin.</p>

<p>This however is not meant to blame a
statue for its polish, as it is conducive to
beauty: though Laocoon informs us, that
the ancients knew the secret of finishing
statues, merely with the chissel. Nor does
the cleanness of the pencil, on a picture,
want its merit: yet it ought to be distinguished
from enamelled tints. A barked
statue, and a bristly picture are alike absurd.
Sketch with fire, and execute with phlegm.
We blame workmanship only as it claims
the first rank; as in the marbles <i>à la Bernini</i>,
and the linnen of <i>Scybold</i> and <i>Denner</i>.</p>

<p>Friend, these instructions may be of use.
For as the bulk of mankind amuse themselves
with the shells of things only, your
eye may be captivated by polish and glare,
as they are the most obvious; to put you
on your guard against which, is leading you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the first step to true knowledge. For daily
observation, during several years, in Italy, has
taught me how lamentably most young travellers
are duped by a set of blind leaders.
To see them skip about in the temple
of art and genius, all quite sober and cool,
puts me in mind of a swarm of new-fledged
grashoppers wantoning in the spring.</p>

<div class="verse">——Χαριτων ἱμερο φωνων ἱερον φυτον.</div>
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Grace is the harmony of agent and
action. It is a general idea: for whatever
reasonably pleases in things and actions is
gracious. Grace is a gift of heaven; though
not like beauty, which must be born with
the possessor: whereas nature gives only the
dawn, the capability of this. Education
and reflection form it by degrees, and custom
may give it the sanction of nature. As water,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>That least of foreign principles partakes,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Is best:</i></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">So Grace is perfect when most simple, when
freest from finery, constraint, and affected
wit. Yet always to trace nature through
the vast realms of pleasure, or through all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the windings of characters, and circumstances
infinitely various, seems to require
too pure and candid a taste for this age,
cloyed with pleasure, in its judgments either
partial, local, capricious, or incompetent.
Then let it suffice to say, that Grace can
never live where the passions rave; that
beauty and tranquillity of soul are the centre
of its powers. By this Cleopatra subdued
Cæsar; Anthony slighted Octavia and the
world for this; it breathes through every
line of Xenophon; Thucydides, it seems,
disdained its charms; to Grace Apelles and
Corregio owe immortality; but Michael
Angelo was blind to it; though all the remains
of ancient art, even those of but middling
merit, might have satisfied him, that
Grace alone places them above the reach of
modern skill.</p>

<p>The criticisms on Grace in nature, and
on its imitation by art, seem to differ: for
many are not shocked at those faults in the
latter, that certainly would incur their displeasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
in the former. This diversity of
feelings lies either in imitation itself, which
perhaps affects the more the less it is akin to
the thing imitated; or in the senses being
little exercised, and in the want of attention,
and of clear ideas of the objects in question.
But let us not from hence infer that Grace
is wholly fictitious: the human mind advances
by degrees; nor are youth, the prejudices
of education, boiling passions, and
their train of phantoms, the standard of its
real delight—remove some of these, and
it admires what it loathed, and spurns what
it doted on. Myriads, you say, the bulk of
mankind, have not even the least notion of
Grace—but what do they know of beauty,
taste, generosity, or all the higher luxuries
of the soul? These flowers of the human
mind were not intended for universal growth,
though their seeds lie in every breast.</p>

<p>Grace, in works of art, concerns the
human figure only; it modifies the <i>attitude</i>
and <i>countenance</i>, <i>dress</i> and <i>drapery</i>. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
here I must observe, that the following remarks
do not extend to the comic part of
art.</p>

<p>The attitude and gestures of antique
figures are such as those have, who, conscious
of merit, claim attention as their due,
when appearing among men of sense. Their
motions always shew the motive; clear, pure
blood, and settled spirits; nor does it signify
whether they stand, sit, or lie; the attitudes
of Bacchanals only are violent, and
ought to be so.</p>

<p>In quiet situations, when one leg alone
supports the other which is free, this recedes
only as far as nature requires for putting
the figure out of its perpendicular. Nay,
in the <i>Fauni</i>, the foot has been observed to
have an inflected direction, as a token of savage,
regardless nature. To the modern artists
a quiet attitude seemed insipid and spiritless,
and therefore they drag the leg at rest forwards,
and, to make the attitude ideal, remove
part of the body’s weight from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
supporting leg, wring the trunk out of its
centre, and turn the head, like that of a
person suddenly dazzled with lightning.
Those to whom this is not clear, may please
to recollect some stage-knight, or a conceited
young Frenchman. Where room
allowed not of such an attitude, they, lest
unhappily the leg that has nothing to do
might be unemployed, put something elevated
under its foot, as if it were like that
of a man who could not speak without
setting his foot on a stool, or stand without
having a stone purposely put under it. The
ancients took such care of appearances, that
you will hardly find a figure with crossed
legs, if not a Bacchus, Paris, or Nireus;
and in these they mean to express effeminate
indolence.</p>

<p>In the countenances of antique figures,
joy bursts not into laughter; ’tis only the
representation of inward pleasure. Through
the face of a Bacchanal peeps only the dawn
of luxury. In sorrow and anguish they resemble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the sea, whose bottom is calm,
whilst the surface raves. Even in the utmost
pangs of nature, Niobe continues still
the heroine, who disdained yielding to Latona.
The ancients seem to have taken advantage
of that situation of the soul, in
which, struck dumb by an immensity of
pains, she borders upon insensibility; to express,
as it were, characters, independent of
particular actions; and to avoid scenes too
terrifying, too passionate, sometimes to paint
the dignity of minds subduing grief.</p>

<p>Those of the moderns, that either were
ignorant of antiquity, or neglected to enquire
into Grace in nature, have expressed,
not only what nature feels, but likewise
what she feels not. A Venus at Potzdam,
by <i>Pigal</i><a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>, is represented in a sentiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
which forces the liquor to flow out at both
sides of her mouth; seemingly gasping for
breath; for she was intended to pant with
lust: yet, by all that’s desperate! was this
very Pigal several years entertained at Rome
to study the antique. A <i>Carita</i> of <i>Bernini</i>,
on one of the papal monuments in St. Peter’s,
ought, you’ll think, to look upon her
children with benevolence and maternal
fondness; but her face is all a contradiction
to this: for the artist, instead of real graces,
applied to her his nostrum, dimples, by
which her fondness becomes a perfect sneer.
As for the expression of modern sorrow,
every one knows it, who has seen cuts, hair
torn, garments rent, quite the reverse of the
antique, which, like Hamlet’s,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">——<i>hath that within, which passeth shew:</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>These, but the trappings, and the suits of woe.</i></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">The gestures of the hands of antique figures,
and their attitudes in general, are those of
people that think themselves alone and unobserved:
and though the hands of but very
few statues have escaped destruction, yet may
you, from the direction of the arm, guess
at the easy and natural motion of the hand.
Some moderns, indeed, that have supplied
statues with hands or fingers, have too often
given them their own favourite attitudes—that
of a Venus at her toilet, displaying to
her levee the graces of a hand,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">——<i>far lovelier when beheld.</i></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The action of modern hands is commonly
like the gesticulation of a young preacher,
piping-hot from the college. Holds a figure
her cloths? You would think them cobweb.
Nemesis, who, on antique gems,
lifts her peplum softly from her bosom,
would be thought too griping for any new
performance—how can you be so unpolite
to think any thing may be held, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
the three last fingers genteely stretched
forth?</p>

<p>Grace, in the accidental parts of antiques,
consists, like that of the essential ones, in
what becomes nature. The drapery of the
most ancient works is easy and slight: hence
it was natural to give the folds beneath the
girdle an almost perpendicular direction.—Variety
indeed was sought, in proportion
to the increase of art; but drapery still remained
a thin floating texture, with folds
gathered up, not lumped together, or
indiscreetly scattered. That these were the
chief principles of ancient drapery, you
may convince yourself from the beautiful
Flora in the Campidoglio, a work of Hadrian’s
times. Bacchanals and dancing figures
had, indeed, even if statues, more
waving garments, such as played upon the
air; such a one is in the Palazzo Riccardi at
Florence; but even then the artists did not
neglect appearances, nor exceed the nature
of the materials. Gods and heroes are represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
as the inhabitants of sacred places;
the dwellings of silent awe, not like a sport
for the winds, or as wafting the colours:
floating, airy garments are chiefly to be met
with on gems—where Atalanta flies</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>As meditation swift, swift as the thoughts of love.</i></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Grace extends to garments, as such were given
to the Graces by the ancients. How would
you wish to see the Graces dressed? Certainly
not in birth-day robes; but rather like a
beauty you loved, still warm from the bed,
in an easy negligée.</p>

<p>The moderns, since the epoch of <i>Raphael</i>
and his school, seem to have forgot that
drapery participates of Grace, by their giving
the preference to heavy garments, which
might not improperly be called the wrappers
of ignorance in beauty: for a thick
large-folded drapery may spare the artists the
pains of tracing the Contour under it, as
the ancients did. Some of the modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
figures seem to be made only for lasting.
<i>Bernini</i> and <i>Peter</i> of <i>Cortona</i> introduced
this drapery. For ourselves, we choose light
easy dresses; why do we grudge our figures
the same advantage?</p>

<p>He that would give a History of Grace,
after the revolution of the arts, would perhaps
find himself almost reduced to negatives,
especially in sculpture.</p>

<p>In sculpture, the imitation of one great
man, of <i>Michael Angelo</i>, has debauched the
artists from Grace. He, who valued himself
upon his being “a pure intelligence”
despised all that could please humanity; his
exalted learning disdained to stoop to tender
feelings and lovely grace.</p>

<p>There are poems of his published, and
in manuscript, that abound in meditations
on sublime beauty: but you look in vain
for it in his works.—Beauty, even the beauty
of a God, wants Grace, and Moses,
without it, from awful as he was, becomes
only terrible. Immoderately fond of all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
was extraordinary and difficult, he soon
broke through the bounds of antiquity,
grace, and nature; and as he panted for
occasions of displaying skill only, he grew
extravagant. His lying statues, on the
ducal tombs of St. Lorenzo at Florence,
have attitudes, which life, undistorted, cannot
imitate: so careless was he, provided
he might dazzle you with his mazy learning,
of that decency, which nature and
the place required, that to him we might
apply, what a poet says of St. Lewis in
hell:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Laissant le vray pour prendre la grimace,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Il fut toujours au delà de la Grace,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Et bien plus loin que les commandements.</i></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He was blindly imitated by his disciples,
and in them the want of Grace shocks
you still more: for as they were far his
inferiors in science, you have no equivalent
at all. How little <i>Guilielmo della<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Porta</i>, the best of them all, understood
grace and the antique, you may see in that
marble groupe, called the Farnese-bull;
where Dirce is his to the girdle. <i>John di
Bologna</i>, <i>Algardi</i>, <i>Fiammingo</i>, are great
names, but likewise inferior to the ancients,
in Grace.</p>

<p>At last <i>Lorenzo Bernini</i> appeared, a man
of spirit and superior talents, but whom
Grace had never visited even in dreams.
He aimed at encyclopædy in art; painter,
architect, statuary, he struggled, chiefly as
such, to become original. In his eighteenth
year he produced his Apollo and Daphne;
a work miraculous for those years, and promising
that sculpture by him should attain
perfection. Soon after he made his David,
which fell short of Apollo. Proud of
general applause, and sensible of his impotency,
either to equal or to offuscate the
antiques; he seems, encouraged by the
dastardly taste of that age, to have formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the project of becoming a legislator in art,
for all ensuing ages, and he carried his
point. From that time the Graces entirely
forsook him: how could they abide with
a man who begun his career from the
end opposite to the ancients? His forms
he compiled from common nature, and
his ideas from the inhabitants of climates
unknown to him; for in Italy’s happiest
parts nature differs from his figures. He
was worshipped as the genius of art, and
universally imitated; for, in our days, statues
being erected to piety only, none to
wisdom, a statue <i>à la Bernini</i> is likelier
to make the kitchen prosper than a Laocoon.</p>

<p>From Italy, reader, I leave you to
guess at other countries. A celebrated
<i>Puget</i>, <i>Girardon</i>, with all his brethren in
<i>On</i>, are worse. Judge of the connoisseurs
of France by <i>Watelet</i>, and of its designers,
by <i>Mariette</i>’s gems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>At Athens the Graces stood eastward,
in a sacred place. Our artists should place
them over their work-houses; wear them
in their rings; seal with them; sacrifice
to them; and, court their sovereign charms
to their last breath.</p>
